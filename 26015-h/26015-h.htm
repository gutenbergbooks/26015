<h2>GRANDMOTHER DEAR'S OLD WATCH</h2>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>A FRAGMENT</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part I</span></h3>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"Those never loved</span><br />
Who dream that they 'loved once.'"&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. B. Browning.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">You</span> won't be long any way, dear Auntie?" said
Sylvia with a little sigh. "I don't half like your going.
Couldn't you wait till the day after to-morrow?"</div>

<p>"Or at least take me with you," said Molly, Sylvia's
younger sister, eagerly.</p>

<p>Auntie hesitated&mdash;she glanced up at as much of
the sky as could be seen through the lace-shrouded
windows of their pretty Paris <i>salon</i>&mdash;it was already
beginning to grow dusky, for though only half-past
three, it was the thirty-first of December, and a dull
day&mdash;and then turned with decision towards the door.</p>

<p>"No, dears," she said; "I shall go more quickly
alone. Sylvia's cold would be none the better for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
going out so late, and I would rather you, Molly,
stayed with her. So good-bye, darlings; I shall not
be long."</p>

<p>"I should not like to think of poor Sylvia sitting
alone in the gloaming, to-day of all days," said
Auntie to herself as she made her way down the
three flights of handsome marble stairs which led to
their <i>appartement</i>. "I can see she is very sad&mdash;remembering
how different it was this day last
year. And dear Molly's good spirits are an inestimable
blessing. Ah, my darlings, I may do my best,
I <i>will</i> do my best, but I cannot make up to you for
grandmother;" and with the tears in her eyes, and
many a tender thought in her heart, Auntie made
her way along the street.</p>

<p>The two girls were watching her, though she did
not know it. There was a tiny balcony outside the
window on to which Molly stepped almost as soon
as the door had closed on Auntie.</p>

<p>"Come out here for a moment, Sylvia," she called
to her sister; "we can see her as far as the corner"&mdash;for
the street was one of the wide handsome avenues
in the new part of Paris, and there were few passers-by.
"As far as the corner," therefore, it was easy
to distinguish Auntie's figure in its deep mourning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
dress&mdash;not <i>quite</i> so erect or active as it used to be,
for Auntie was no longer young, and this year, so
nearly ended now, had brought her the greatest
sorrow of her life&mdash;as she quickly made her way.</p>

<p>"Dear Auntie," said Sylvia; "I wish she were
back again. I am sure we could have done without
money for a day."</p>

<p>"<i>Two</i> days it would have been," corrected Molly;
"the bank will be closed to-morrow, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course I know that," said Sylvia, a little
testily.</p>

<p>"And there are some people coming to be paid,
and Auntie never likes to keep any one waiting,"
continued Molly imperturbably. "If Auntie had
only taken me with her&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How absurd you are!" said Sylvia. "You speak
as if Auntie were a baby, or as if no one could take
care of her but you&mdash;no, dear," she broke off hastily,
"I should not speak like that. I don't mean to be
cross&mdash;but oh, Molly, how we do miss grandmother,"
and the quickly rising tears in the pretty eyes raised
to her sister's face at once subdued any resentment
Molly may have felt. She bent her tall figure&mdash;for,
though nearly two years younger, she was taller than
her sister&mdash;and enveloped Sylvia in a loving hug.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"My darling," she said&mdash;the mass of fair hair,
which, even at eighteen, she found it no easy matter
to keep in order, mingling with Sylvia's soft clustering
chestnut locks; "my darling&mdash;of course we do&mdash;but,
Sylvia, we must try to be happy. Think
how <i>she</i> always said so. And next year&mdash;next year
may be happier. Papa and Ralph are almost sure to
be with us again by this time next year."</p>

<p>"<i>This</i> year has certainly only brought us sorrow,"
said Sylvia mournfully; "I wish Auntie had not
gone out. I have a presentiment something will go
wrong."</p>

<p>"Don't be fanciful, dear; Auntie will soon be
back. Come in and let us get ready a cosy tea for
her, and finish the old year as cheerfully as we can.
And oh, Sylvia&mdash;your cold!&mdash;and you've been out on
the balcony without even a shawl."</p>

<p>No wonder these girls loved their aunt. Since
their infancy their grandmother and she had replaced
to them the mother they had never known&mdash;and the
father who was but seldom able to be with them.
And now the grief, the inexpressible grief of having
lost that dearest of grandmothers had deepened and
strengthened the affection of the three for each other.
Their life was somewhat lonely at present. Grandmother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
had died in the south, at the pretty villa
which, after so many years passed in it, had come to
seem "home." But she had wished her grandchildren
to return to England, their real home; there,
before long, to be rejoined by their father and elder
brother at present in the East. And they were
spending this winter in Paris&mdash;"on the way," as it
were&mdash;for the benefit of Sylvia's drawing and Molly's
music; and partly, too, perhaps, because the old
home in the south, <i>without</i> "grandmother dear,"
would have seemed too unbearably desolate.</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn, the fire blazed brightly,
the lamp on the <i>console</i> at the side of the room
threw a soft pleasant glow on the dainty table set
out temptingly for "afternoon tea," which, notwithstanding
their long residence in France, Auntie and
her nieces were very fond of. And with the little
exertion of making all as bright and pretty as they
could, the girls' spirits had come back.</p>

<p>"It <i>does</i> look nice," said Molly approvingly, as she
stepped back towards the door to judge of the general
effect. "How I do wish dear grandmother were here
to see how neat and nice it looks. I really do think,
Sylvia, that I am getting to be very 'handy,' and to
have a good deal of taste in nice little ways&mdash;just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
what grandmother used to wish for me;" and the
candour and honesty in her fair face as she innocently
expressed her little bit of self-approval made Sylvia
turn away so that Molly should not see the smile of
amusement it was impossible altogether to repress.
For Molly's open satisfaction with herself when it
seemed to her that she deserved a little encouragement,
was one of the funniest things about her
still.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, it does look very nice," said Sylvia.
"And&mdash;&mdash;Can that be Auntie's ring already?" she
broke off. "How very quick she has been."</p>

<p>And almost before she had finished the words the
door was thrown hastily open, and Auntie was beside
them. But what an Auntie! Pale, looking older
by ten years than when she had left them, breathless,
her lips for a moment trembling so that she
could not speak. The girls' warm words of welcome
died away as they gazed at her in terror.</p>

<p>"Auntie, Auntie dearest, what is it; oh, what is
it?" they exclaimed, while visions of every possible
and impossible misfortune&mdash;a telegram with bad
news of papa or Ralph taking front place as the
worst of all&mdash;rushed before their imaginations with
the inconceivable rapidity with which such speculations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
picture themselves at such times of excitement.
Auntie struggled for self-control.</p>

<p>"No, no&mdash;not bad news," she whispered at last,
in answer to some all but inaudible breath which
had perhaps escaped the poor children's lips. "You
must&mdash;oh, you must forgive me. It was all my
own fault. I should not have gone."</p>

<p>"Oh Auntie, Auntie," cried Molly, by this time in
sobs, "what is it then? Have you been run over?"</p>

<p>"How could Auntie be here if she had been?"
said Sylvia, hardly able to help smiling, even in the
midst of her fright, at the Molly-like question. "But
oh, Auntie, do try to tell us."</p>

<p>Auntie was a little calmer by now. She looked
up with a piteous expression in her still white face.</p>

<p>"My dears, my dears," she said, "you must not
be vexed with me, and yet I feel that you have a
right to be so. I have had such a misfortune&mdash;I
have lost&mdash;just now, on my way to or from the bank,
I don't know which&mdash;I have <i>lost</i> dearest mother's&mdash;your
grandmother's old watch! And with it the
locket that was always attached to it, you know&mdash;the
one with <i>her</i> great-grandfather's and his daughter's
hair."</p>

<p>"I know," said Molly, "gray hair on one side and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
bright brown like Sylvia's on the other. Oh, Auntie,
Auntie&mdash;<i>poor</i> Auntie."</p>

<p>And Sylvia flung herself down beside poor Auntie
and burst into tears of sympathy. It was sweet to
Aunt Laura, even in the midst of her acute distress,
to feel that their first thought was not for the loss
itself&mdash;much as it could not but touch them&mdash;but of
sorrow for <i>her</i>.</p>

<p>"Grandmother's old watch&mdash;grandmother dear's
old watch," repeated the two girls, as if they could
not believe it. The old watch they remembered all
their lives, whose face was almost as familiar to them
as that of grandmother herself&mdash;the watch and locket
which seemed almost a part of her&mdash;it was terrible,
it was too bad to be true!</p>

<p>"How did it happen?" said Sylvia, trying to choke
down her tears. "Tell us more, Auntie. Can nothing
be done? You don't think it was stolen?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I feel sure I dropped it. I remember now
that it was not securely fastened. That is what vexes
me so terribly&mdash;to think it was my own fault! Oh,
Sylvia&mdash;oh, Molly, when I saw it was gone I felt as
if I should go out of my mind! It was just as I
came out of the bank that I missed it, but it may
have dropped some minutes before. I was hesitating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as to whether I should have time to walk home, or
if I should take a <i>coup&eacute;</i> so as to get back to you
quicker, my dears&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we had made all so cosy for you&mdash;such a
dear little tea&mdash;just look, Auntie;" and herself casting
a glance round at their pretty preparations, Molly's
tears flowed afresh.</p>

<p>"I had a presentiment," said Sylvia. "But go
on, Auntie."</p>

<p>"And I looked at my watch&mdash;I mean, I was going
to do so," continued Auntie, "and found it was gone.
Of course I ran back to the bank, but it was not
there. I rushed up and down the street and asked
everybody I saw&mdash;I even went into some of the
shops&mdash;I am afraid I must have seemed quite dazed.
Then my only idea was to get back to you, so I called
a <i>coup&eacute;</i> and&mdash;&mdash;" here poor Auntie broke down again.</p>

<p>"And is there nothing to be done?" repeated Sylvia.</p>

<p>"The coachman," said Auntie, "the coachman
advised me to go to the 'commissaire de police'
nearest to where I lost it. I have the name of the
street. So now that I have seen you, I will go there
at once," and she rose as she spoke. "Take my bag,
Molly dear," she added, handing it to her. "The
money is in it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a good thing <i>it</i> wasn't lost too," said Molly,
whose spirits were already beginning to reassert
themselves. "But, Auntie, you must have some tea
before you go. It is <i>quite</i> ready."</p>

<p>Auntie, whose hand was already on the door, was
beginning to refuse when Sylvia interrupted. "Yes,
Auntie dear, you <i>must</i>," she said. "And while you
are taking it, it will give me time to get ready."</p>

<p>"You, my child! I will not let you come&mdash;with
your cold too."</p>

<p>"My cold is very little, Auntie dearest; I must
come&mdash;I should come," she added pleadingly. "You
can't go about by yourself, so upset as you are too.
<i>Grandmother</i> told me I was to take care of you. Yes,
Molly dear, I know you would go, but I am a year
and nine months older," continued Sylvia, rising to
the dignity of her nineteen years. "It is right I
should go."</p>

<p>She gained the day, and so did Molly, to the
extent of persuading her aunt to swallow a cup of
tea,&mdash;what a different tea-taking to that they had
been looking forward to!&mdash;and in five minutes Auntie
and Sylvia were driving along the streets which the
former had but so lately passed through.</p>

<p>"Poor Molly," said Auntie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"She will be getting up her hopes and expecting
us to bring back good news," said Sylvia. "Well,
we <i>may</i> find it, Auntie. They say honest people
<i>sometimes</i> take things at once to the nearest police-office."</p>

<p>But this small grain of hope was quickly crushed.
The "commissaire de police" was civil, but not encouraging.
The ladies would do better to wait a day
or two and then apply to the "Pr&eacute;fecture de Police,"
in other words, the central office, where waifs and
strays of private property, should they chance to fall
into honest hands, were pretty sure to be eventually
deposited.</p>

<p>"A day or two," repeated Auntie, appalled. "Can
I do nothing at once?"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders. "That was as Madame
chose. It would do no harm to write at once,
describing the lost articles and giving her address.
But as for hearing of them at once, that was more
than improbable. It was the eve of the New Year&mdash;the
worst day of all the year on which to have such
a misfortune; everybody respectable was busy with
their own affairs; and yet there were lots of beggars
and such like about the streets. If&mdash;even supposing,"
as if the supposition were of the wildest&mdash;"that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the watch had fallen into honest hands, a week or
ten days would probably pass before Madame would
have news of it."</p>

<p>"And if it were deposited <i>here</i>," said Auntie
timidly&mdash;"that does sometimes happen, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"If it were deposited here, it would be as if it
were not here," said the commissaire sententiously.
"That is to say we should send it on to the Pr&eacute;fecture.
I have not even the right to tell you if it is
at this moment here or not, though to give you
pleasure," he proceeded with unconscious sarcasm,
"I will declare to you that it is <i>not</i>."</p>

<p>"Then there is no use my returning here again to
inquire?"</p>

<p>"Not the least&mdash;write to the Pr&eacute;fecture making
your statement, and call there four or five days hence&mdash;no
use going sooner," said the commissaire with a
wave of his hand in token of dismissal. So Auntie
and Sylvia, with sinking hearts, turned sadly away.</p>

<p>"Little does he understand what four or five days
of suspense seem to me," said Auntie.</p>

<p>"To <i>us</i> too, dear Auntie," said Sylvia, squeezing
Auntie's arm under her cloak as they made their
way home through the now dark streets, Auntie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
preferring to walk now that there was plainly no
more to be done that called for haste.</p>

<p>"That is the worst of it&mdash;I have made this New
Year time still sadder than it need have been for you
two, my darlings."</p>

<p>It was hard to go in with no good news for Molly,
whose spirits, as Sylvia had foreseen, had already
risen to the point of feeling sure her aunt and sister
would return triumphant, treasure-retrove in hand!
But even now she was not disconcerted. "A week
or ten days," she repeated, when she had heard all
there was to tell; "ah, that shows, Auntie dear, we
need not give up hope for ever so long."</p>

<p>She had need of her good spirits for herself, and
the others too, during the days that followed. It
would be impossible and wearisome to relate all that
Auntie did and tried to do. The letters to "all in
authority" in such matters, the visits to the Pr&eacute;fecture
de Police, to the company who took charge of
printing and posting handbills promising rewards for
the restoring to their owners of lost objects, to the
famous "Montde Pi&eacute;t&eacute;," the great central pawnbroker's
of Paris, even&mdash;&mdash;For a week and more Auntie
and the two girls, so far as it was possible for them
to help her, did little else than exhaust themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
in such efforts, seizing every suggestion held out by
sympathising friends, from the <i>concierge</i> to their old
friend the white-haired Duchesse de St. Gervais, who
related to them a long and interesting but slightly
irrelevant story of how a diamond ring of her great-grandmother's
had been found by the cook in the
heart of a cauliflower just as she was about to boil it
for dinner!</p>

<p>"I really think," said Auntie weariedly, as she
threw herself down on the sofa after an expedition
to the office of the most widely read Paris daily
paper, where she had spent a small fortune in
advertisements, "I really think quite half the world
is constantly employed in finding, or rather searching
for, the things that the other half is as constantly
employed in losing. I could fill a three-volumed
novel with all I have seen in the last few days&mdash;the
strange scenes, the real tragedies of feeling&mdash;the truly
wonderful mechanism of all this world of functionaries
and offices and regulations. And some of these
people have been really so kind and sympathising&mdash;it
is astonishing&mdash;one would think they would be
too sick of it all to have any feeling left."</p>

<p>"I am sure <i>anybody</i> would be sorry if they understood
that it was dear, <i>dear</i> grandmother's watch&mdash;and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
even if they knew nothing, any one would be sorry if
they saw your poor dear sweet little unhappy face,"
said Molly consolingly.</p>

<p>But though her words called forth a rather wintry
smile from Auntie and Sylvia, it was with sad hearts
that all three went to bed on the night of the ninth
day since the loss.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Part II</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Up</span> ever so many pairs of steep winding stairs, somewhat
later that same evening, in a small barely
furnished little room in one of the busiest and most
thickly inhabited parts of Paris, a young woman with
a baby on her knees was seated in front of a small
fire. It was cold&mdash;for, alas, in the dwellings of the
poor want of fresh air and ventilation does not mean
<i>warmth</i>&mdash;and now and then she stirred the embers,
though carefully, as if anxious to extract what
warmth she could without exhausting its source.</div>

<p>"I must keep a little fire together for Bernard,"
she said to herself. "He is late this evening. Perhaps
I had better put the little one to bed&mdash;still it is
cold for her, for it would not yet be prudent to lay
her beside Paul, though he is so much better. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a blessing he is so much better, my poor little boy!
One should not complain, even though it is hard to
think of what this fortnight's illness has cost, fifty
francs at least, and my work in arrears. And to
think of that watch lying there useless all this time!
Not that I would have Bernard sell it, even if we
dared. But still I can understand the temptation
were it a thing one <i>could</i> sell, to many even poorer
than we. To-morrow, if there is still no advertisement
in any of the papers, I really think I will no
longer oppose Bernard's taking it to the police, and
giving up all hopes of any reward, and even of the
satisfaction of knowing its real owner has got it.
For they say lost objects sometimes lie at the Pr&eacute;fecture
for years, and it does not look as if the person
it belongs to was very eager to get it back, otherwise
it would have been advertised or placarded. Perhaps
it is some one very rich, who has many watches;
and yet&mdash;that old locket with the date of more
than a hundred years ago, so simple too, evidently
preserved as a family relic, and the watch too, old,
though still so good, as the watchmaker next door
assured Bernard, worth quite two or three hundred
francs. Perhaps the owner is very distressed about
it, but still three or four hundred francs could not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
possibly be to him or her what they would be to us
just now! Why, even <i>one</i> hundred would get us
nicely round the corner again!"</p>

<p>For Madame Bernard was a sensible little woman
with no exaggeration about her. But it is growing
colder, and still her husband does not return. She
must gather the remnants of the fire together, and
baby at all costs must go to bed, and if Bernard does
not soon come she herself must go too. She cannot
risk catching a bad cold herself just as Paul is
recovering from an attack of bronchitis. And she is
turning to open a door leading into the one bedroom
of their <i>appartement</i>, when the well-known sound
of a latch-key in the door of the tiny vestibule
arrests her.</p>

<p>"Bernard, at last!" she exclaimed with a sigh of
relief.</p>

<p>A man, young still, though older than she, entered.
He was thin and pale and poorly clad. But his face
was intelligent and pleasant, and he had an undoubted
air of respectability. And to his wife's accustomed
eye, late as it was and tired as he should have been,
his face had a flush of excitement on it which half
prepared her for news of some kind.</p>

<p>"At last," he repeated. "Yes, I am very late, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
I will not grumble as I did this evening when we
were told we must work overhours, for it is thanks to
the lateness that I have&mdash;prepare yourself, my girl&mdash;I
have found the owner of the watch!"</p>

<p>"The owner of the watch!" repeated his wife.
"How? where? But you had not the watch with
you? You have not given it back? Not without&mdash;&mdash;" and
the little woman hesitated; her husband
seemed so pleased, so excited. "If possibly it is a
poor person," she reflected, "Bernard is quite capable
of giving it back with delight for nothing but a
word of thanks! Yet what would not forty, nay,
even fifty francs be to us just now." Still she did
not like to say anything to damp his pleasure. But
he read her misgiving&mdash;he had perhaps a little enjoyed
teasing her!</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, my child," he said, though
Madame Bernard was certainly much less excited
than he; "it is all right. When I said I had found
the owner, I meant to say I know <i>where</i> to find him,
or her. Twenty minutes ago I knew as little as you
do at this moment. But coming along the Boulevart,
suddenly the light of a gas-lamp flaring up a little
fell on a yellow paper on the wall&mdash;had it been in
the daytime I should never have seen it, it was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
badly placed&mdash;'fifty francs reward.' I scarcely
thought I would stop to read it at first; how many
yellow posters have I not read these last few days!
But in an instant 'watch' caught my eyes. Here
is the description;" and he drew out a shabby
pocket-book in which he had copied it word for word.
"You see it is our old friend, and no other&mdash;'English
watch, locket, <i>souvenir de famille</i>, etc. Owner to be
found at 99 Avenue Malmaison.' So off I go to
No. 99 to-morrow morning as early as I possibly
can."</p>

<p>"And you will be very careful, Bernard," said his
wife. "Give it up to no one but the owner himself."</p>

<p>"And make sure of the reward, eh, my girl?" said
he, laughing. "Yes, yes&mdash;you may trust me. I
know fifty francs will not fall to us badly just now.
And if it is a rich person I shall take it with a
clear conscience, for I really have worked to find the
owner."</p>

<p>And in very much better spirits than they had
been since the beginning of little Paul's illness, the
poor young couple betook themselves to their night's
rest.</p>

<p>One person at No. 99 Avenue Malmaison had
not known what a good night's rest was for some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
time. Poor Auntie! she was beginning to feel that
she must make an effort to resign herself, and to
throw off the excessive depression which the loss of
"grandmother's" watch was causing her. It was not
fair, she argued, to make Sylvia and Molly suffer for
what she and she alone deserved to be blamed for.
So she tried to look more cheerful than she felt. I
don't think her efforts deceived the two pairs of
sympathising young eyes, but the sisters nevertheless
understood and appreciated them, and felt that
they too must put on a braver face than came quite
easy. So to all outward appearance the trio had
recovered their usual bearing. And Sylvia and
Molly, as was only natural, went to bed and slept
soundly, though never without a last waking thought
of "Poor Auntie! oh, if the watch <i>could</i> but be
found!" while the watch's owner tossed about in
wakeful distress. The more she tried to look bright
in the day, the more impossible it seemed to forget
her troubles in the temporary oblivion of a sound
sleep. "It is really wrong of me to fret so about the
loss of any <i>thing</i>," she would say to herself. "I
seem more overwhelmed than even during the first
few terrible days after mother's death. Though
after all, <i>were</i> those first few days terrible? Just at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the first when the door seems still as it were half-open,
and we feel almost as if we could see a little
way <i>in</i>, where our dear ones have gone&mdash;no, those
first days are <i>not</i> the worst."</p>

<p>And somehow, as she said so to herself, there
seemed to fall over Auntie a feeling of calm and
peacefulness such as she had known little of for
long. Then came before her the remembrance of
"grandmother dear's" sweet, quiet face as she had
seen it the last time, in the beautiful calm of holy
death. "It is <i>wrong</i> to fret so, my child," the well-known
voice seemed to say. And listening to it
Auntie fell into a quiet and profound sleep.</p>

<p>It was curious&mdash;a sort of coincidence, I suppose,
one would call it&mdash;that this peaceful sleep came to
poor Auntie just at the moment at which Bernard,
on his way home, espied by the light of the flaring
gas-lamp the yellow poster with its "fifty francs
reward" in big black letters!</p>

<p>When Auntie woke she saw at once by the light
that it was much later than her usual time. But
she felt so quiet and peaceful and rested&mdash;almost as
one does on waking from the first real sleep after
an illness&mdash;that she tried to fancy she was still half-dreaming,
and that it could not yet be time to get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
up. A slight noise&mdash;a <i>very</i> slight noise it was&mdash;at
the side of her bed made her at last, though reluctantly,
open her eyes again and turn slightly round.
Quick ears and watchful eyes were on the alert&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, Auntie&mdash;Auntie dear&mdash;you are awake at
last. You have had a nice sleep?"</p>

<p>"Very&mdash;a very sweet sleep, my darling," said
Auntie, smiling, for the last night's impressions were
strong upon her. She was not going to make herself
unhappy any more about that which could not
be cured.</p>

<p>Molly's bewildered eyes turned towards her sister.</p>

<p>"She looks so happy," she whispered. "Can she
know, can she have heard us talking?"</p>

<p>No&mdash;she had heard nothing&mdash;but <i>something</i>, some
indefinable instinct now seemed suddenly to awaken
her suspicions.</p>

<p>"Molly&mdash;Sylvia!" she exclaimed, starting up.
"What is it? What are you saying? It cannot
be&mdash;&mdash;" But before she had time to say more she was
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Yes, it <i>can</i> be&mdash;it <i>is</i>," they called out. And
something, a softly shining something, round and
smooth, with a smaller shining thing attached to it,
dangled above her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>"The watch, Auntie&mdash;grandmother dear's own
old watch, and the locket! A man&mdash;such a nice
civil poor man&mdash;found them, and has brought
them back, while you were still asleep."</p>

<p>"And we could not bear to waken you. You
looked so tired and white, and were sleeping so
quietly. But it was all right," Molly hastened to
assure her. "We lent the money&mdash;the fifty francs
reward, you know&mdash;and he was so pleased, poor man.
I am afraid he is <i>very</i> poor."</p>

<p>"He asked for a certificate&mdash;a little note to say
he had been honest in bringing it back," added
Sylvia. "But we thought, and so did he, that it
would be better for you to write it. So he is going to
call again&mdash;to-morrow or the day after in the evening&mdash;it
is such a long way off where he lives, he
says."</p>

<p>"What good will the certificate do him?" asked
Auntie, stroking and smoothing her dear watch all
the time.</p>

<p>"He said it might get him promoted in the office
where he works," said Molly, "And he says the
watch is a <i>very</i> good one&mdash;he took it to a friend of
his who is a jeweller. So you see, Auntie, though
he couldn't have sold it here&mdash;you remember they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
told us it was impossible to sell jewellery that isn't
one's own here, as one has to tell all about where
one got it and all that&mdash;he might have kept it for
himself."</p>

<p>"Or sent it away to be sold somewhere else," said
Sylvia.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, no doubt he could have done something
with it, if he hadn't been really honest."</p>

<p>"And yet so poor," said Auntie thoughtfully.
Then she looked again at the watch with such a
loving gaze that it brought tears to the girls' eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, Auntie darling, <i>how</i> nice it is to see you
looking like yourself again," said Molly. "It
seems almost, doesn't it," she added in a lower voice,
"as if its coming back were a little message from
grandmother?"</p>

<p>How different appeared everything that happy
day! How bright the sunshine, even though but
some pale wintry beams struggling through the cold
gray sky; how nice everything they had to eat
seemed&mdash;was it, perhaps, that the kind-hearted cook
in her sympathy took unusual pains?&mdash;how Auntie
smiled, nay, laughed right out, when Molly suddenly
checked herself in saying something about what
o'clock it was, forgetting that it was no longer a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
painful subject! How grateful they all felt to be
able to go to bed in peace without the one ever-recurring,
haunting thought, "If the watch could
but be found!"</p>

<p>And with the night came another thought to
Auntie.</p>

<p>"Sylvia and Molly," she said the next morning,
"I have been thinking so about those poor people&mdash;the
man who found the watch I mean&mdash;and his
family," for he had told them he was married and
had children. "I do feel so grateful to him. I feel
that I must go and see for myself if they are so very
poor. You have the exact address?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes," Molly replied, "we wrote it down.
But oh, Auntie dear, you <i>will</i> let us go with you."</p>

<p>Auntie hesitated a little, but yielded in the end.</p>

<p>"You will promise to let me go in first," she said,
"just to see that it is quite respectable, and no infectious
illness or anything that could hurt you."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Bernard hardly knew his little wife again when
he got home that evening. The fifty francs had
greatly cheered her the night before, but their influence
could not explain the state of delight between tears
and laughter in which he found her this time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my friend&mdash;oh, Bernard," she exclaimed,
"what a happy thing it was for us that you found
the watch's owner and took it at once! They have
been here; only fancy such distinguished ladies
coming themselves so far just to see if they could be
of any service to us in return for ours to them.
That was how they put it&mdash;was it not touching?
The old lady"&mdash;poor Auntie, I don't think she
would <i>quite</i> have liked that!&mdash;"to whom belongs
the watch, so good and kind, oh, so kind; and the
younger ones two angels, <i>angels</i> simply, I repeat it,
Bernard. And when they heard all&mdash;I could hide
nothing, they questioned me with such sympathy,
about Paul's bronchitis and all&mdash;they set to work
to consider how best they could help us. The lady
gave Paul, into his own little hand, another note of
fifty francs. That will clear off everything, and
make us quite as well off as before his illness; and
besides that, they have a good deal of work they
want me to do, that will be well paid, better paid
than what I do for the shops. And they will try to
recommend me to some of their friends,&mdash;what I have
always wished for, to work for ladies direct instead
of for the shops. Oh, Bernard, it was a happy day
for us when you found that old watch!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>There is no need to say that Auntie and her nieces
were as good as their word.</p>

<p>"On the whole," said Molly, with her customary
philosophy, "it was almost worth while to go through
all the unhappiness for the sake of the delight of
getting the watch back again, especially as it really
has been a good thing for those nice poor people. But,
Auntie, you will have all your dresses made with
watch-pockets now, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I will," said Auntie with a smile, "and
thank you for your good advice, my Molly. Who
would think you had ever been the complacent
possessor of six pinless brooches?"</p>

<p>At which Molly and Sylvia both laughed, though
Molly blushed a little too.</p>

<p>"I am really careful now, I do think," she said.
"You know, dear Auntie," she added in a lower
voice, "Sylvia and I, more than ever, <i>now</i>, try to do
and be all that <i>she</i> wished, in little as well as in big
things. Dear, dear grandmother!"</p>

<h3>Chapter I</h3>

"For there is no friend like a sister<br />
<span style="margin-left: .5em;">In calm or stormy weather&mdash;&mdash;."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='sig2'>
<span class="smcap">Christina Rossetti</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">It</span> is getting to be "a good while ago" since I was a
little girl. Sometimes this comes home to me quite
distinctly: I feel that I am really growing an old
woman, but at other times I cannot believe it. I
have to get up and cross the room and look at myself
in the mirror, and see with my own eyes the
gray hairs and the wrinkles in order to convince
myself that childhood, and maidenhood, and even
middle age, are all left far behind. At these times
"now" appears the dream, "then" the reality; and,
strangely enough, this very feeling, I am told, is one
of the signs of real old age, of our nearing the land
that at one time we fancied so "very far off"&mdash;farther
off, it seems to me, in middle age than in early childhood,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
when it is easier for us to believe in what we
cannot see, when no clouds have come between us
and the true sky beyond.</div>

<p>I have been in many countries, and lived many
different lives, since I was a little girl. I have been
months together at sea, when dry land itself seemed
almost to become a dream. I have been for long
years in India, and grown so used to burning skies
and swarthy faces that I could hardly believe in the
reality of cool England, with its fresh fields and
shady lanes; yet all these scenes are growing hazy,
while clearly, and yet more clearly, there rises before
me the picture of my old, old home and childish
days, of special things that happened to me then, of
little pleasures and troubles which then seemed very
great, and in one sense really were so, no doubt, for
they were great to <i>me</i>.</p>

<p>I will tell you about a trouble I once had, if you
like. I am afraid you will hardly count it a <i>story</i>,
but still some among you may find it interesting.
For, after all, children are children even nowadays,
when so much more is done to make them clever
and wise than was the case when I was a little girl;
and the feeling that your parents and grandparents had
their childish sorrows and joys, and hopes and fears and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wonders, just as you have, is always a good and wholesome
feeling to foster on both your side and theirs.</p>

<p>Our home was in a small town in rather an out-of-the-way
part of the country. It is out of the way
still, I believe, as the railways have not gone very
near it, but I know little about it now. It is many
years since I was last there, and I do not think I
wish ever to see it again. I would rather keep my
memory's picture of it unchanged.</p>

<p>Our house stood at the outskirts of the little
town; in front of it there stretched a wide heathery
common, which extended a mile or two into the
country; and over this common, at certain seasons,
the west wind blew so strongly that it was, we used
to say, really like living at the seaside. The sea was
only six or eight miles away; sometimes we fancied
the wind "tasted salt."</p>

<p>The house itself was comfortable and old-fashioned,
and had plenty of rooms in it, which you will allow
to have been necessary when I tell you that I was
the youngest of nine children, most, or at least many,
of whom had been brought up at home. My eldest
sister was married&mdash;she had always been married, I
thought, for I could not remember her anything else.
My other three sisters were all more or less grown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
up, and the only brother at all near my own age was
away at a boarding-school. So it came to pass that,
though I had so many brothers and sisters, I was
rather a solitary little girl.</p>

<p>But I was not an unhappy child by any means.
I had everything I wanted, even down to a tiny
little bedroom all to myself; and though I was not
perhaps indulged as much as some children I see
nowadays, I don't think I was on that account to
be pitied. My parents were quiet, and perhaps
rather unusually undemonstrative; and indeed it
was not then the fashion to be very familiar with
one's father and mother. We always said "sir" and
"ma'am" to them, and I never thought of entering
or leaving the drawing-room without stopping to
curtsey at the door. How would you like that,
children? My father was very particular about
such matters, more so than most, perhaps, from
having been many years in the army, where, I once
overheard an old brother-officer say, he had been
considered rather a "martinet," if you know what
that means; and my dear mother, who by herself,
perhaps, would have been almost too gentle to keep
all her family in good order, was firm as a rock where
any wish of <i>his</i> was concerned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Till I was nearly nine years old I was exceedingly
fond of dolls, of which I had several of different
degrees of ugliness. But about that age I was taken
away for a few weeks to visit an aunt of my mother's
at the seaside, and as we travelled all the way there
and back in the coach, our luggage had to be much
less in quantity than can now be comfortably stowed
away in the van of an express train. And "Lois
must leave her dolls at home" was the decision of
my sixteen-year old sister Emilia, who, with my
mother and myself, was to make the journey.</p>

<p>At first I was greatly distressed, though, being a
very quiet and uncomplaining child, I said little.</p>

<p>"Mayn't I take one?" I said humbly to my
mother. "Miss Trotter or Lady Mirabelle would take
up so little room; or might I carry one in my arms?"</p>

<p>Emilia, my sister, was desired to look over the
dolls and report on them. She did so, but, alas!
most unfavourably.</p>

<p>"They are such disreputable-looking things," she
said half-laughingly to my mother, "I should really
be ashamed for my aunt to see them. She likes
everything so neat, you know. And mother, Lois
is really growing a great girl&mdash;don't you think it is
a good time to break her of dolls?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>So my dolls were left behind. I don't think I
grieved <i>very</i> much over them. The excitement of
the journey and the being considered a great girl by
Emilia went far to console me. Besides, I had been
beginning to find such big dolls rather inconvenient,
as I did not care to play with them in the common
way merely. My great pleasure was in making them
act the different characters in some romance of my
own concoction, and I found smaller <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
more easily managed. Of late I had even tried to
cut out figures in paper for this purpose, but I could
not make them anything but grotesque and ugly,
and had for some time past been "casting about" in
my mind as to some less objectionable puppets.</p>

<p>How well I remember the first night at Sandilands!
The journey I have somehow almost forgotten.
I suppose it was in no way very remarkable,
and it is not unlikely that I fell asleep in the
coach, and that this had to do with what followed.</p>

<p>My great-aunt was a tiny little old lady, so tiny
that small as I was myself she made me feel clumsy.
Her house, too, was in proportion to herself. She
received us with the greatest affection, but was so
nervously anxious to make us comfortable that I
could not but feel strange and shyer than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Notwithstanding my mother's encouraging whispers
and Emilia's tugs and nods, I showed myself to sad
disadvantage, which was especially unfortunate, as I
was Aunt Lois's god-daughter, and had been brought
to see her on purpose to please her. I spilt my tea,
I trod on the cat's tail, I knocked over a valuable
Indian jar filled with pot-pourri, which fortunately,
however, was not broken, till at last, in despair, my
mother agreed to Emilia's repeated suggestion that I
had better go to bed.</p>

<p>And to bed I went, in considerable distress,
though a little consoled by the kind way in which
my aunt kissed me and patted me on the back as
she said good-night.</p>

<p>I was to sleep in a small room, generally used as
a sort of study. My aunt had thoughtfully arranged
a little bed in it for me, thinking the only other
unused bedroom, which was up at the top of the
house, would be so far away from my mother and
Emilia that I should feel lonely. I went to bed
quietly, and, notwithstanding the strangeness of
everything about me, soon fell asleep. But an hour
or two later, just when my mother and aunt were
sitting comfortably chatting, and Emilia trying over
some old songs on the thin-toned piano, they and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the two maid-servants in the kitchen were suddenly
startled by piercing screams from my room.</p>

<p>Upstairs they all ran&mdash;Emilia arriving the first.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Lois?" she exclaimed.
"Have you set yourself on fire?"</p>

<p>I was sitting up in bed, my eyes almost starting
out of my head with fright.</p>

<p>"The faces, the faces!" I cried. "See, Emilia,
up there!"</p>

<p>It was a minute or two before she could see what
I meant, and by that time my mother and aunt and
the servants were all in the room. Emilia would
have scolded me, but Aunt Lois hurried forward and
soothed me, oh, so kindly, while she explained that
what in my half-awakened state I had taken for two
faces were nothing but two Dutch china vases, standing
on the top of a high old-fashioned cabinet in a
corner of the room. The door having been left
slightly ajar, a ray of light from the lamp on the
landing had penetrated into the room, just catching
the cabinet, while leaving everything else in darkness.</p>

<p>I sobbed and cried for some time, but persisted
in staying where I was instead of changing places
with Emilia, as was proposed, now that I really
knew there was nothing to be afraid of.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brave girl!" said my aunt approvingly. "And
to-morrow, for a reward, you shall have the key of
the cabinet and examine it for yourself. It is filled
with curious foreign shells, and if you care for them
you shall have some to take home with you."</p>

<p>And with this delightful anticipation I fell peacefully
asleep.</p>


<h3><br />Chapter II</h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My</span> aunt was as good as her word. The next morning,
when breakfast was over, she went up with me
to my little room and unlocked the cabinet. It was,
as she had said, filled with lovely curious shells, of
every size and shape. Some of the trays were in
considerable disorder.</div>

<p>"You may put them straight for me, Lois, my
dear," she said, "and when you have done so, you
may play with them every day while you are here.
And when you go away I shall give you a few. I
cannot give you many, for the cabinet was arranged
and given to me by my dear brother, who is dead,
and I should not like to spoil the look of it. But
before you go you may choose twenty to take away
with you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Aunt Lois," I said soberly. But
she must have seen by my face that I was pleased,
for she added&mdash;</p>

<p>"And when I die, Lois, you shall have the cabinet
and all the shells."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Aunt Lois," I said again, not indeed
knowing what else to say, though I felt rather uncomfortable
when she talked of dying.</p>

<p>After this, for some days to come, I was perfectly
happy. Morning, noon, and night I was at the
shells. The only trouble was that it was a grief to
me ever to leave them, and of course, as I had been
brought to Sandilands partly for the benefit of the
sea-air, my mother could not allow me to spend all
my time in one small room.</p>

<p>One day, just after our early dinner, I had escaped
to my treasures as usual, when Emilia followed me
upstairs to tell me to put on my hat and cape for a
walk by the sea-shore. My face fell, but of course I
did not venture to make any objection.</p>

<p>"Can't you bear to tear yourself away from your
shells even for an hour?" said Emilia. "What a
queer child you are! What can you find to play at
with them; they are all arranged in perfect order
long ago?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are so pretty. I like putting their colours
together," I said, fondly touching, as I spoke, the
shells of one tray, which were my especial favourites.</p>

<p>"Yes, they <i>are</i> pretty," said Emilia. "How lovely
that delicate pink one is, in the middle of those
dark-brown tortoiseshell-looking ones! It is like a
princess surrounded by her slaves."</p>

<p>I started with pleasure. Emilia's suggestion
opened a new world to me. Here before me, in
my shells, were the very puppets I had been in
search of!</p>

<p>"Oh, Emilia!" I exclaimed, "<i>what</i> a good idea!"</p>

<p>But when she questioned me as to what I meant,
I got shy again, and refused to explain. I was afraid
of her laughing at me, and hurried away to put on
my hat, more eager than ever to get back to these
delightful playfellows, as I really considered them.</p>

<p>And what games did I not have with them! I
made them act far more wonderful dramas than I
could possibly describe to you, children. I went
through ever so many of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> stories,
with the shells for caliphs and weseers, genii, and
enchanted damsels. I acted all the well-known old
fairy tales, as well (or better) known in my childish
days as now: Cinderella and dear Beauty and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Riquet with the tuft. There was one brown shell
with a little hump on its back which did splendidly
for Riquet. Then for a change to more sober life
I dramatised <i>The Fairchild Family</i> and <i>Jemima
Placid</i>, taking for my model a little book of plays
for children, whose name, if I mistake not, was
<i>Leisure Hours</i>.</p>

<p>But through all my fanciful transmogrifications I
was constant in one particular: the beautiful pale-rose-coloured
shell which Emilia had admired was
ever my <i>prima donna</i> and special favourite. It&mdash;I
very nearly had said "she"&mdash;was in turn the
lovely wife of Hassan of Balsora, Princess Graciosa,
and Lucy Fairchild, whom, on mature consideration,
I preferred to her sister Emily, as, though not so
pretty, she was never guilty of such disgraceful conduct
as eating "plum jam" on the sly and then
denying it! And when no special "actings" were
on hand, and my beautiful shell might have been
supposed to be nothing but a shell, the pleasures of
my fertile imagination were by no means at an end.
The pretty thing then became a sort of beloved friend
to me. I talked to it, and imagined it talked to me;
I confided to it all my hopes and fears and disappointments,
and believed, or pretended to myself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
to believe rather, that the shell murmured to me in
reply sweet whispers of affection and sympathy; I
carried it about with me everywhere, in a tiny box
lined with tissue-paper and cotton-wool; indeed it
seems to me now that many, perhaps most people, if
they had heard what nurses call "my goings-on,"
would have thought my wits decidedly wanting.
But <i>of course</i> I told no one of my new fancy. I
don't think at that time I <i>could</i> have done so. I
lived in a happy dream-world of my own alone with
"my pink pet," for that was the only "real" name
I ever gave to the shell, and no longer in the least
regretted Miss Trotter or Lady Mirabelle, though I
often "amused" my present favourite with stories of
the sayings and doings of its predecessors in my
affections.</p>

<p>Of course my pink pet accompanied me home.
There was great consultation with my shell as to the
nineteen others to be chosen, and there was one
moment's breathless suspense when my aunt told me
to show her my selection, and I gravely did so,
watching her face the while.</p>

<p>What if she should refuse to me the gift of the one,
for which I would gladly have gone without all the
others?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have made a very modest choice, Lois," she
said at last. "Are you sure you wouldn't like any
others better? These are rather rare shells," she
added, touching a little group of two or three that
generally figured as my pink pet's maids of honour,
"but these, and this, and this&mdash;are common
enough."</p>

<p>"But this is the only one of the sort in the
cabinet," I replied, reddening with vexation, for my
favourite had been one of those Aunt Lois had
described as "common." Actually, at the risk of
losing my beautiful shell, I could not help standing
up in its defence.</p>

<p>"Why, that's the one I thought so pretty, isn't
it?" said Emilia, coming forward. "Lois thinks it
worth its weight in gold, aunt. She keeps it in an
old pill-box, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're <i>very</i> unkind, Emilia," I exclaimed angrily;
"you've no business to pry into what I do."</p>

<p>"Hush&mdash;hush! my dear," said Aunt Lois in her
fussy way, yet not unkindly, and looking at me with
some curiosity. "Give me my spectacles, and let me
see this remarkable shell better. Yes&mdash;you are right,
your young eyes are sharper than mine, it <i>is</i> a rare
shell. I think there were only two of them in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
cabinet, and one must have been broken, though I
did not know it."</p>

<p>Oh, how I trembled! Supposing Aunt Lois were
to say she could not spare this one precious specimen!
Emilia put my thoughts into words for me,
for which I did not thank her.</p>

<p>"If it is the only one," she said, "of course Lois
won't expect you to give it to her." She glanced at
me reproachfully. My eyes fell, but I did not speak.</p>

<p>"I would not on any account go back from my
promise," said my aunt. "If the child has a special
fancy for the shell, let her have it by all means, even
were it far more valuable than it is."</p>

<p>I could hardly speak, so great had been my
suspense, but I whispered "Thank you, Aunt Lois,"
in a husky voice, and I fancy by the way my aunt
again looked at me that she saw there were tears in
my eyes. And the next day we went home.</p>



<h3><br />Chapter III</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 347px;">
<img src="images/i054.png" width="347" height="600" alt="MY PINK PET" title="MY PINK PET" />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">After</span> this I grew fonder than ever of my pink pet.
But at the same time I was more careful than before
to let no one know of my queer fancy. Emilia's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
remarks had alarmed me, for I had had no idea that
she had noticed my treasure. I could not bear being
laughed at, and I intensely dreaded my brothers
getting hold of the story and playing me some trick
which might deprive me of my favourite. I never
played with my shells except when I was quite alone,
and deeply regretted there being no key to the lock
of my room, by which I might have secured myself
against intruders. But as I had always been in the
habit of playing a great deal by myself, and had
always, too, been quiet and reserved, no one took any
special notice of me or my occupations, particularly
as every one in the house was just then much
occupied with preparations for the approaching
marriage of my second sister, Margaret. So I spent
hours and hours by myself&mdash;or rather not by myself,
for I had for my companions far more wonderful
beings than were ever dreamt of anywhere save in
a child's brain, and with my pink pet went through
more marvellous adventures by far than Munchausen
himself.</div>

<p>One day I was playing as usual in my own little
room, when the door suddenly opened and Emilia
and Margaret came in. They were both laughing.
I started up in terror and threw my handkerchief<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
over the little group of shells, who had just been
performing a tournament on a cane-bottomed chair,
on the seat of which, with an old piece of French
chalk, I had marked out the lists, the places for
spectators, and the da&iuml;s of honour for the queen,
represented of course by my rose-coloured shell.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Lois?" said Emilia.</p>

<p>"Nothing, at least only playing," I said confusedly.</p>

<p>"We didn't suppose you were doing anything
naughty," said Margaret. "Don't look so frightened.
Let us see what you are playing at."</p>

<p>I hesitated.</p>

<p>"Come now," said Emilia laughingly, "do let us
have it. You had got as far as&mdash;let me see what
was it, 'Oh ladye fair, I kneel before thee,' wasn't
that it, Margaret?"</p>

<p>I turned upon her in sudden fury. But before I
could speak, Emilia, not noticing my excitement, had
snatched away the handkerchief from the chair, and
with mischievous glee picked out my pink pet.</p>

<p>"See, Margaret," she cried, "this is the 'ladye
fair,' Lois's familiar."</p>

<p>I had found my voice by now&mdash;found it indeed;
it would have been better had I remained silent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, you mean girl!" I exclaimed. "Oh, you
bad, wicked sister! You've been listening at the
door; am I not even to be allowed the privacy of
my own chamber?" I was growing dramatic in my
excitement, and unconsciously using the language of
some of my persecuted heroines.</p>

<p>"Lois," cried Margaret, "do not excite yourself
so. We did not listen at the door, but you were
speaking so loud, I assure you it was impossible not
to hear you."</p>

<p>Somewhat softened and yet inexpressibly annoyed,
I turned to Margaret, unfortunately in time to see
that it was only by the greatest efforts she was controlling
her laughter. My words and manner had
been too much for her, anxious as she was to quell
the storm.</p>

<p>"I will bear no more," I said passionately. "Unnatural
sisters that you are to jeer and mock at me.
Give me my shell, Emilia. How dare you touch
it?"</p>

<p>Startled, and really a little frightened by my
manner, Emilia silently held out the shell. I
snatched at it, how it was I never could tell&mdash;whether
she or I dropped it I know not, nor do I
know whose foot trod on it, but so it was. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
scuffle my treasure fell to the ground; my pink pet
was crushed into a little heap of shell dust.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lois, dear Lois, I am so sorry," exclaimed
Emilia, all her mischief and glee at an end. But I
did not speak. For a moment I stared at the fatal
spot on the floor, then stooping down I scooped up
as well as I could the fragments of what had been
so dear to me, and hiding them in my hand rushed
from the room, still without speaking. I really
hardly knew what I was doing; afterwards I remembered
hearing Emilia say in a frightened tone&mdash;</p>

<p>"Margaret, what can we do? I never saw Lois
like that before. Can she be going out of her mind?"</p>

<p>I thought I <i>was</i> going out of my mind. Even
now, children, old woman as I am, I cannot bear
to recall the misery of that time. I ran out into
the garden, and lay with my face hidden in an old
deserted arbour, where I trusted no one would come
to seek me. I had put the "ashes" of my favourite
into the pill-box, and held it in my hands while I
cried and sobbed with mingled anger and grief. The
afternoon went by, but no one came to look for me.</p>

<p>"It must be nearly tea-time," I said to myself,
though reluctant to own that I was hungry. "No
one cares what becomes of me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then I heard a step approaching. It was
Emilia.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lois!" she exclaimed; and I could tell by
her voice that she had been crying. "I have been
looking everywhere for you. Oh, dear Lois, do say
you forgive me?"</p>

<p>"No," I said sullenly, turning from her and pushing
away her outstretched arms, "I will <i>never</i> forgive
you."</p>

<p>And this was my only reply to her repeated words
of sorrow and affection, till at last in despair she
went away. Then, knowing that my retreat was
discovered, I got up and went into the house, up
to my own room. I sent down word by one of the
servants that my head ached, and I did not want
any tea, and my mother, judging it wiser from my
sisters' account of me not to drive matters to extremity,
let me have my own way. She came up
to see me, and said quietly that she hoped my head
would be better to-morrow, but that was all, and I
encouraged nothing more, and when Emilia came to
my door to say good-night, I would not answer
her.</p>

<p>The next day things were no better. By this
time my continued crying had really made my head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
ache more badly than it had ever ached before. I
got up and dressed, but had to lie down again, and
thus I spent the day; and when my sisters came in
to see me I would not speak to them. Never, I
think, was child more perfectly miserable; and
though I gave little thought to that part of the
matter, I can now see that I must have made the
whole household wretched. And yet by this time I
was doing myself the greatest injustice. I was no
longer angry with Emilia. I was simply sunk in
grief. My pink pet was crushed into dust; how it
had happened, or who was to blame, I did not care.
I was just broken-hearted.</p>

<p>I think it must have been the evening of the
second day after the tragedy of the shell that I was
sitting alone in my little room, when there came a
tap at the door. "Come in," I said listlessly, never
for a moment supposing it to be any one but the
housemaid. The door opened and I glanced up.
My visitor was Aunt Lois. I had forgotten all
about her coming, though I now remembered hearing
that she was expected a week or two before
Margaret's marriage.</p>

<p>"Aunt Lois!" I exclaimed, starting up, but when
I felt her bright kindly eyes looking at me inquiringly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
I grew red and turned away; but she came
forward all the more eagerly.</p>

<p>"So my poor little girl," she said, "I hear you
have been in great trouble."</p>

<p>I did not speak&mdash;I began to cry quietly.</p>

<p>"And some one else has been in trouble too," she
said; "you have made Emilia very unhappy."</p>

<p>I raised my head in surprise. "Emilia!" I repeated;
"she doesn't care. She only laughed at
me."</p>

<p>"She <i>does</i> care, Lois," said my aunt. "She has
tried to tell you so several times."</p>

<p>"Yes," I said confusedly, "she did; but I didn't
think anybody cared <i>really</i>."</p>

<p>"No, you have been thinking of no one but yourself,
Lois; that is the truth, dear. But now listen
to me, and don't think I am going to laugh at you.
I understand how you have been feeling. Once,
when I was a little girl, I was very nearly as miserable
about the loss of a&mdash;guess now&mdash;what <i>do</i> you
think?"</p>

<p>I looked up with interest.</p>

<p>"I don't know," I said; "was it a pet bird, or
something like that?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Aunt Lois, "nothing half so sensible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
I don't think you could guess. It was nothing but
a little sugar mouse, which I had had for some
weeks, till at last one day, forgetting that it was
only sugar, I left it so close to the fire that it melted.
But many times in my life I have thought of my
poor mouse with gratitude, Lois. It taught me some
good lessons. Can you guess what they were?"</p>

<p>"Not to care too much for things, I suppose," I
said.</p>

<p>"Not <i>exactly</i> that. I don't think 'caring' ever
does us harm; but <i>what</i> one cares for, that is the
thing. You will understand in good time."</p>

<p>I looked up again, thoughtfully this time.</p>

<p>"I think I do understand, a little," I said. "You
are so kind, Aunt Lois."</p>

<p>"I don't like to see people unhappy if I can cheer
them," she said. "Do you, Lois?"</p>

<p>I did not reply.</p>

<p>"Shall I call Emilia?" she said. "You can make
<i>her</i> happy again."</p>

<p>"Please," I whispered.</p>

<p>Aunt Lois went to the door, and I heard her call
my sister. She must have been waiting somewhere
near, for in a moment she was in the room. She
ran up to me and put her arms round me and kissed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
me fondly&mdash;more fondly I think than ever any one
had kissed me before.</p>

<p>"Dear little Lois," she said, "I have been <i>so</i> sorry
about you. Won't you forgive me? And I have
not been a good sister to you&mdash;I have left you alone
to make amusement for yourself when I might have
helped you. Aunt Lois has shown me it all, and I
want to begin now quite differently, so that you
shall never feel lonely again."</p>

<p>I kissed her in return. Who could have helped
doing so? There were tears in her eyes&mdash;those
merry bright eyes that I had never before seen
looking sad; and it seemed to me that all of a
sudden I found out how sweet and pretty Emilia
was.</p>

<p>"Dear Emilia," I said, and then touching a little
knot of pale-rose-coloured ribbon that she happened
to be wearing, and which seemed just to match the
pretty flush in her cheeks, I whispered very low,
"Will <i>you</i> be my pink pet, Emilia?"</p>

<p>She laughed happily. "That reminds me," she
said, and out of her pocket she drew a tiny box,
which she gave me. I opened it, and gave a little
cry of surprise. There, in a nest of cotton-wool, there
lay before me, lovely as ever, my beloved shell!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Emilia!" I exclaimed, "where did you get it?
It was broken to bits."</p>

<p>"I brought it," said Aunt Lois. "Don't you remember
my saying there had once been two of those
rare shells? Emilia wrote to ask me to hunt all
through the cabinet to see if possibly the other was
still there; and I actually did find it. It was hidden
in a very large shell, that somehow or other it had
got into&mdash;one of the large shells you seldom played
with."</p>

<p>"How kind of you, and of Emilia," I said. Then
I looked at the shell again. "I should like to keep it
<i>always</i>," I said, "but I won't make a pink pet of it."</p>

<p>And I always did keep it. It lies now in a corner
of my trinket-case, where it has lain for many years,
and where little fingers have often reverently touched
it, when I told them it was a keepsake from the dear,
merry Aunt Emilia their young eyes had never seen&mdash;sister
and dearest of friends while she lived, most
precious of memories when she died. For she died
many years ago; but before many years more have
passed, I smile to think that God will let us be again
together, and this is one of the thoughts that makes
me not regret to feel that I am really growing into
quite an old woman.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>AN HONEST LITTLE MAN</h2>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Our</span> Baby is very fond of coming down to dessert.
I almost think it is the greatest pleasure in his
small life, especially as it is not one that very often
happens, for, of course, as a rule, he has to go to bed
before father and mother begin dinner, and dessert
comes at the end of all, even after grace, which I
have often wondered at. Our Baby is four; he has
rather red hair, and merry-sad eyes, if you know
what I mean; and in summer, because his skin is
so very fair&mdash;"quite lost on a boy," nurse says&mdash;he
has a great many freckles, especially on his dear
little nose. He is a great pet, of course, but not in
a very babyish way&mdash;he seems too sensible for that;
and he is very gentle and thoughtful, but not at all
"soft" or cowardly. Our Baby has a brother&mdash;he is
really, of course, brother to us all; but Baby seems
to think he is only "budder" to him&mdash;a very big,
almost grown-up brother, Baby considers him, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
he is nearly seven! Well, one evening lately both
these little boys came down to dessert for a great
treat, because an auntie had come on a visit, and this
was the first night. They were both so pleased.
"Brother" was chattering and laughing in what we
call his "big man way," and Baby smiling soberly.
That is his way when he is pleased, and that reminds
me how we did laugh the first night he ever came
down! He was so dreadfully solemn and quiet we
thought he was going to cry, and father said, "That
child had better go to bed, he looks so miserable;"
but when I asked him if he would like to go up,
he looked at me and smiled, and said, "Oh no,
Cissy. He's very happy;" and then we saw he
really was, only he thought looking solemn was the
best of good manners, for afterwards he told
"Brother" he thought "gemplemens and ladies
never laughed at dinner!" But he was more at
home this evening that Auntie had come, and
though he did not make any noise, any one could
see he was happy. He was sitting by Auntie, who
was very pleased with him, and without any one
happening to notice, she took a cocoa-nut biscuit
from a plate in front of her and gave it to him.
He took it quietly, but did not eat it, for he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
that "Budder" had not got one, and though our
little boys are not the least jealous of each other,
they are very fond of being what they call "egwall,"
and if one gets anything, he likes the other to get
the same.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 365px;">
<img src="images/i068.png" width="365" height="600" alt="AN HONEST LITTLE MAN" title="AN HONEST LITTLE MAN" />
</div>

<p>Auntie went on speaking, and did not see
that Baby did not eat his biscuit, but held it tight
in his little hand. And in a minute or two mother
looked round and said, "I must find something my
little boys will like." Then she drew the cocoa-nut
biscuits to her and chose two, a pink one and a
white one&mdash;you must know there is nothing we
children think such a treat as cocoa-nut biscuits&mdash;and
handed them to them.</p>

<p>"Budder" took his and said, "Thank you, mother;"
but what do you think dear Baby did? Instead of
taking it, as he might easily have done, without any
one's ever knowing of the other&mdash;and, indeed, if
they had known, they couldn't have said it was
naughty of him&mdash;he held out his hand with the
biscuit already in it, and said quite simply, not the
least as if he thought he was doing anything very
good, "Him has one, zank you."</p>

<p>"Honest little man," said mother, and then Baby's
face got red, and he did look pleased. For mother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
does not praise us often, but when she does it is
for something to be a little proud of, you see, and
even Baby understands that.</p>

<p>And Auntie turned and gave him a kiss.</p>

<p>"You dear little fellow," she said; and then in a
minute, she added, "that reminds me of something
I came across the other day."</p>

<p>"What was it? Oh, do tell us, Auntie," we all
cried.</p>

<p>Auntie smiled&mdash;we are always on the look-out
for stories, and she knows that.</p>

<p>"It was nothing much, dears," she said, "nothing
I could make a story of, but it was pretty, and it
touched me."</p>

<p>"Was it a bear," said Baby, "or a woof that
touched you?"</p>

<p>"Silly boy," said "Budder"; "how could it be a
bear or a woof? Auntie said it was something
pretty."</p>

<p>And when she had left off laughing, she told us.</p>

<p>"It was the other day," she said, "I was walking
along one of the principal streets of Edinburgh,
thinking to myself how bitterly cold it was for May.
Spring has been late everywhere this year, but
down here in the south, though you may think you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
have had something to complain of, you can have
no idea how cold we have had it; and the long
light days seem to make it worse somehow! Well,
I was walking along quietly, when I caught sight of
a poor little boy hopping across the road. I say
'hopping,' because it gives you the best idea of
the queer way he got along, for he was terribly
crippled, and his only way of moving was by something
between a jerk and a hop on his crutches. And
yet he managed to come so quickly! You would
really have been amused to see the kind of fly he
came with, and how cleverly he dodged and darted in
and out of the cabs and carriages, for it was the busiest
time of the day. And fancy, children, his poor
little legs and feet from his knees were quite bare.
That is not a very unusual sight in Edinburgh, and
not by any means at all times one to call forth pity.
Indeed, I know one merry family of boys and girls
who all make a point of 'casting' shoes and stockings
when they get to the country in summer, and
declare they are much happier without. Their
father and mother should be so, any way, considering
the saving in hosiers' and shoemakers' bills.
But in the case of my poor little cripple it was
pitiful; for the weather was so cold, and the thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
legs and feet so red, and the poor twisted-up one
looked so specially unhappy.</p>

<p>"'Poor little boy,' I exclaimed to the lady I was
with; 'just look at him. Why he has hopped all
across the street merely for the pleasure of looking
at the nice things in that window!'</p>

<p>"For by this time the boy was staring in with all
his eyes at a confectioner's close to where we were
passing.</p>

<p>"'Give him a penny, do,' said my friend, 'or go
into the shop and buy him something.'</p>

<p>"We went close up to the boy, and I touched him
on the shoulder. He looked up&mdash;such a pretty,
happy face he had&mdash;and I said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Well, my man, which shall I give you, a penny
or a cookie?'</p>

<p>"He smiled brightly, but you would never guess
what he answered. Like our 'honest little man'
here," and Auntie patted Baby's head as she spoke,
"he held out his hand&mdash;not a dirty hand 'considering'&mdash;and
said cheerfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Plenty to buy some wi', thank ye, mem;' and
spying into his hand I saw, children, one halfpenny."</p>

<p>Auntie stopped. I think there were tears in her
eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what did you do, Auntie?" we all cried.</p>

<p>"What could I have done but what I did?" she
said. "I don't know if it would have been better not&mdash;better
to let his simple honesty be its own reward.
I could not resist it; of course I gave him another
penny! He thanked me again quite simply; I am
sure it never struck him that he had done anything
to be praised for, and I didn't praise him, I just gave
him the penny. And oh, how his bright eyes
gleamed! He looked now as if he thought he had
wealth enough at his command to buy all the cookies
in the shop."</p>

<p>"So he hadn't only been pertending to buy," said
"Budder." "Poor little boy, he had been toosing&mdash;toosing
what he would buy. I'm so glad you gave
him anoder penny, Auntie."</p>

<p>"He's so gad him got anoder penny," echoed
Baby; though, to tell the truth, I am not sure that
he had been listening to the story. He had been
making up for lost time by crunching away at his
biscuit. And when the boys said "Good night,"
Auntie gave them each another biscuit, and mother
smiled and said it was because it was Auntie's first
night. But "Budder" told Baby afterwards, by
some funny reasoning of his own, that they had got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
another biscuit each, "'cos of that poor little boy who
wasn't greedy."</p>

<p>And Baby, of course, was quite satisfied, as
"Budder" said so.</p>

<p>I think I shall always remember that little
cripple boy when I see cocoa-nut cakes, and it
will make me like them, if possible, better than
ever.</p>

<h2>THE SIX POOR LITTLE PRINCESSES</h2>

<div class='poem'>
"And all the Christ Child's other gifts .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but still&mdash;but still&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The doll seem'd all my waking thoughts to fill.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='sig2'>
<i>The Doll that ne'er was Mine.</i><br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">There</span> were six of them, beginning with Helen and
ending with Baby, and as Helen was only twelve
and Baby already five, it is easy to understand that
they were all pretty near of a size. But they weren't
really princesses. That was all Jinny's planning.
Indeed most things which were nice or amusing or
at all "out-of-the-way" were Jinny's planning.</div>

<p>Jinny's long name was Ginevra. She came third.
Helen and Agatha were in front of her, and below
her came Elspeth and Belinda and Baby. Baby had
a proper name, I suppose, but I never heard it, and
so I can't tell you what it was. And as no one ever
did hear it, I don't see that it much matters. Nor
would it have mattered much if Belinda had had no
proper name either, for she was never called anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
but Butter-ball. The story was that it was because
she was so fat; and as, like many fat people, she was
very good-natured, she did not mind.</p>

<p>They were all together in the nursery, together
but alone, as was rather often the case; for they
had no kind, comfortable old nurse to spoil and scold
them by turns, poor children, only a girl that Miss
Burton, the lady whom they lived with, kept "to do
the nursery work," which does not sound like being
a nice nurse at all, though I suppose Miss Burton
did not understand the difference. There were a
good many things she did not understand. She liked
the children to be neatly dressed, and to have good
plain food in plenty; she was very particular that
they should do their lessons and go for a walk every
day when it was fine enough, but that was about all
she thought of. She did not think they needed any
fun except what they could make for themselves,
and even then it must not be too noisy; she could
not understand that they could possibly be "dull,"
caged up in their nursery. "Dull," when there were
six of them to play together! She would have
laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>They had few story-books and fewer toys. So
they had to invent stories for themselves, and as for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the toys, to make believe very much indeed. But
how they would have succeeded in either had it not
been for Jinny I should be afraid to say.</p>

<p>"It's a shame&mdash;a regular shame," said Ginevra.
She was sitting on the table in the middle of the
room with Elspeth beside her. The two little ones
were cross-legged on the floor, very disconsolately
nursing the battered remains of two very hideous
old dolls, who in their best days could never have
been anything but coarse and common, and Helen
and Agatha sat together on a chair with a book in
their hands, which, however, they were not reading.
"It's a shame," Ginevra repeated; "even the little
princes in the tower had toys to play with."</p>

<p>"Had they?" said Helen. "Is that in the history,
Jinny?"</p>

<p>"It's in some history; anyway, I'm sure I've
heard it," Jinny replied.</p>

<p>"But this isn't a tower," said Agatha.</p>

<p>"No, it's a dungeon," replied Ginevra grimly.
"And if any of you besides me had the spirit of a
true princess, you wouldn't stand it."</p>

<p>"We don't want to stand it any more than you
do," Helen said quietly. "But what are we to do?
You don't want to run away, do you? Where could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
we run to? It isn't as if papa was anywhere in
England. Besides, we're not starved or beaten, and
we're in no danger of having our heads cut off."</p>

<p>"I'd rather we were&mdash;there'd be some fun in that,"
said Princess Jinny.</p>

<p>"Fun!" repeated Agatha.</p>

<p>"Well, it wouldn't be as stupid as being shut up
here in this dreary old nursery&mdash;I mean dungeon,"
said Ginevra. "And now that our cruel gaoler has
refused to let us have the small solace of&mdash;of a&mdash;"
she could not find any more imposing word&mdash;"<i>doll</i> to
play with, I think the time has come to take matters
into our own hands, princesses."</p>

<p>"I've no objection," said Helen and Agatha, speaking
together. "But what do you mean to do?"</p>

<p>"You shouldn't call Miss Burton a gaoler&mdash;she
isn't as bad as <i>that;</i> besides, she's not a man," said
Elspeth, who had not before spoken. "We might
call her the governor&mdash;no, governess; but that sounds
so funny, 'governess of the tower,' or custo&mdash;then
some word like that, of the castle."</p>

<p>"But this isn't a tower&mdash;we've fixed that&mdash;nor a
castle. It's just a dungeon&mdash;that'll do very well,
and it's great fun at night when we put out the
candles and grope about in the dark. And gaoler<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
will do very well for Miss Burton&mdash;some are quite
kind, much kinder than she."</p>

<p>"It's all along of our never having had any
mamma," said a slow, soft little voice from the floor.</p>

<p>"Princess Butter-ball, what a vulgar way of speaking
you have!&mdash;'all along of'&mdash;I'm ashamed of you,"
said Jinny severely. "Besides, we did have a mamma
once&mdash;all except&mdash;&mdash;" and she glanced at Baby, but
without finishing her sentence. For had she done so
poor Princess Baby would have burst into loud sobs;
it was a very sore point with her that she had never
had a mamma at all, whereas all the others, even
Butter-ball, were perfectly sure they could remember
their mother.</p>

<p>"If Aunt Ginevra would come home," sighed
Elspeth. "We've always been promised she would."
"And she's written us kind letters," added Agatha.</p>

<p>"What's letters?" said Jinny contemptuously.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't complain," said Helen. "She
sent you a silver mug&mdash;real silver&mdash;and that's more
than any of our godmothers did for the rest of us."</p>

<p>"Yes, she did," said Jinny, "and it's fortunate for
us all, princesses, that through all our troubles I
have always kept that one&mdash;memento of happier
days about my person&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"What stories, Jinny!" Agatha exclaimed. "At
least it's stories if you're being real just now. You
mix up princess-ing and real, so that I get quite
muddled. But, you know, you <i>don't</i> carry the mug
about with you."</p>

<p>For all answer, Princess Ginevra, after some
fumbling in her pocket, drew out a short, thick
parcel wrapped in tissue paper, which she unfolded,
and held up to view a silver mug.</p>

<p>"There now," she said.</p>

<p>Agatha looked rather crestfallen.</p>

<p>"It must be very uncomfortable to have that
lumpy thing in your pocket, and some day Miss
Burton will be asking where it's gone," she said. "I
suppose it makes you fancy yourself more a princess,
but I'm getting rather tired of fancies. Now if we
only had a beautiful doll, and could all work at
dressing it, that <i>would</i> be worth something."</p>

<p>"And we might go on being princesses all the
same, or even more," put in Elspeth.</p>

<p>"Patience," said Jinny, "patience and courage.
Leave it to me. I think I see my way. I have my
eye on a trusty adherent, and if I am not much
mistaken, you shall have a doll before Christmas."</p>

<p>All five pricked up their ears at this&mdash;they had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
all at the bottom of their hearts the greatest faith in
Ginevra, though the elder ones now and then felt it
necessary to snub her a little.</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest, Jinny?" said Helen; "and
if you are, I wish you'd tell us what you mean. Who
is the trusty adherent?"</p>

<p>"I know," said Agatha. "It's the red-haired boy
next door. Jinny dropped her umbrella the other
day and he picked it up for her, and she stopped to
thank him&mdash;that day we had colds and couldn't go
out, Helen."</p>

<p>"No," said Elspeth; "it was Jinny that picked
up some of his books that dropped&mdash;he was carrying
such a pile of awfully messy ragged ones. He must
go to a messy school."</p>

<p>"He was not going to school," said Ginevra. "He
was taking these old books to&mdash;but no, I must not
betray him."</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said Agatha; "he can't be more than
nine. What could there be to betray? <i>He's</i> not a
shut-up prince, Jinny. Do talk sense for once."</p>

<p>Ginevra changed her tone.</p>

<p>"I don't want to tell you," she said in a matter-of-fact
voice, "for fear of disappointing you all. Just
wait a very few days and then I'll tell you. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
first, <i>supposing</i> we could get a doll, what should it
be like&mdash;fair or dark?"</p>

<p>"Dark, black hair and brown eyes," replied all
the five voices. For the six princesses had fair
curls and blue eyes, so, naturally, they preferred a
contrast.</p>

<p>"Hum," said Tinny. "Brown hair, perhaps,
but not black. The black-haired dolls in the shop-windows
look common."</p>

<p>"Never mind. <i>Any</i> haired would do so long as
we got her," said Agatha. "But don't talk about
it. It does make me want her <i>so</i> dreadfully."</p>

<p>Late that afternoon, just about the time that the
little boy next door would be coming home from
school, a small figure with a shawl drawn over its
head might have been seen at Miss Burton's front
gate. She had waited patiently for some minutes.
At last she was rewarded by the sight, or the sound
rather, for it was almost too dark to see any one, of
Master Red-Head coming up the road. When he
got close to his own door she called out. It was
rather difficult to do so, for she had no idea what his
name was.</p>

<p>"Master&mdash;Mr.&mdash;" she began, and then changing
suddenly, "boy, please, I don't know your name."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped and came up to her, exclaiming of
course, "I say, who's there? What's up?"</p>

<p>"It's me&mdash;Prin&mdash;I mean one of the little girls
next door, the one who picked up your old books
the other day. I want to ask you something,
please."</p>

<p>Red-Head was all attention, and the two went on
talking for some minutes.</p>

<p>"You're sure he will?" said Jinny at last.</p>

<p>"Quite positive. I'll get all out of him I can.
It's real silver, you say."</p>

<p>"Real, pure silver," she replied.</p>

<p>"And&mdash;and it's your very own? I mean you
may do what you like with it?" Red-Head went on,
for he was a boy with a conscience.</p>

<p>"Of course it's my own. Do you think I'd steal?"
exclaimed Jinny indignantly, so indignantly that
she omitted to answer his second question, not even
asking it of herself.</p>

<p>"No, no, of course not. But you know&mdash;<i>I</i> wouldn't
get leave to sell my watch though it's my own. Only
I suppose it's all because you've no father and mother
to look after you. It's very hard on you to have no
toys. I suppose girls can't live without dolls. But
I say, tell me again about the doll. I'll have to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
it all at once, for we're going away for the holidays
the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You're to get all the money you can, and the
very prettiest doll you can have for the money.
With brown hair, remember&mdash;not light, we're tired
of light, we've all got it ourselves&mdash;and not black,
black's common."</p>

<p>"And not red, I suppose. You may as well say
it. I don't mind."</p>

<p>"Well, no," said Ginevra hesitatingly. She would
not for worlds have hurt his feelings&mdash;no princess
would so treat a trusty adherent&mdash;yet she could not
pretend to a weakness for red hair. "I <i>think</i> we'd
like brown best."</p>

<p>"All right. Then to-morrow afternoon, just about
this time. It's a half-holiday&mdash;we're breaking up,
but it's best to wait till dark for fear you should get
a scolding. I'll be here just about this time, with&mdash;you
know what."</p>

<p>"Thank you, oh thank you so much," and Ginevra
held out her hand, half expecting him to kiss it, instead
of which, however, he gave it a schoolboy shake.</p>

<p>"I can excuse it, however; he could not be expected
to understand," she said to herself as she flew
up to the nursery.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 343px;">
<img src="images/i086.png" width="343" height="600" alt="THE SIX POOR LITTLE PRINCESSES" title="THE SIX POOR LITTLE PRINCESSES" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>She could scarcely sleep that night, and the next
morning it was all she could do to keep her secret.
But there was plenty of determination under Princess
Jinny's fair curls, and by dint of much squeezing of
her lips together and saying to herself what a pity
it would be to spoil the beautiful "surprise," she
managed to get through the morning without doing
more than dropping some mysterious hints. But how
long the day seemed, short as it really was! Would
it never get dark? For it was clear and frosty, and
the afternoon, to Jinny, appeared, out of contradiction,
to be twice as long as usual of closing in.</p>

<p>"All comes, however, to him (or her) who waits,"
and the blissful moment at last arrived when Ginevra
found herself running upstairs, though not so fast as
the evening before, for fear of dropping the precious
parcel she held in her arms.</p>

<p>"The dear, sweet boy," she said to herself. "I'd
have liked to kiss him. Perhaps we all might when
he comes home again."</p>

<p>For Red-Head's last words had been a charge not
to forget to let him know after the holidays if Miss
Dolly was approved of.</p>

<p>Ginevra burst into the nursery.</p>

<p>"Princesses," she exclaimed, "shut your eyes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
while I unwrap her. I'll shut mine too. I haven't
seen her myself."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;can it be&mdash;the doll?" they all cried, and
their hearts nearly stopped beating with excitement.</p>

<p>"Now," Jinny exclaimed.</p>

<p>They all pressed forward. All six pairs of eyes
were fixed on Jinny's lap, but not a sound was heard.
A blank look of disappointment fell over every face.
Red-Head, poor Red-Head had done his best, but oh,
what a mistake! He had bought a <i>dressed</i> doll, and
as ten and sixpence, which was all he had got for
the mug, will not go very far in such articles, it can
be imagined that dolly herself, notwithstanding the
gorgeousness of her attire, fell short, lamentably short,
of the poor princesses' expectations.</p>

<p>"She's only china, and her hair's a put-on wig,"
said Agatha, with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"Her clothes don't even take off and on, and
they're not a bit like a little girl's clothes," said
Elspeth.</p>

<p>Ginevra said not a word; her face told of nothing
less than despair.</p>

<p>"And poor darling Jinny has sold her mug to
buy it with&mdash;all to please us. I found it out, but it
was too late to stop it," said Helen. "Jinny darling,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
we must like her, we <i>will</i>&mdash;any way she'll be better
than nothing. We'll make her new clothes, and then
perhaps she won't look so vulgar," whereupon, Helen
setting the example, all the five princesses fell upon
Jinny's neck and hugged and kissed her and each
other amidst their tears.</p>

<p>"And we mustn't tell Red-Head," said Jinny;
"he'd be <i>so</i> disappointed. He did his best. I never
thought of saying she wasn't to be dressed. He's
going away to-morrow, and of course they wouldn't
change the doll after he comes back. Besides, she <i>is</i>
better than nothing, surely?"</p>

<p>Christmas Eve&mdash;the six princesses sat on the
window-sill looking out on the fast-falling snow.
Dolly&mdash;partially denuded of her gorgeous attire, but
looking rather woe-begone, if less self-satisfied and
vulgar, for new clothes "to take on and off," and of
irreproachable good taste, are not to be fashioned by
little fingers in a day&mdash;was reposing in Butter-ball's
fat arms. They "took turns" of her, as was the fairest
arrangement under the circumstances of six little girls
and only one doll; and, true to the sound philosophy of
her being "better than nothing," a certain half-contemptuous
affection for her had taken the place of
the first dislike.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly&mdash;rat-tat-tat at the front knocker.</p>

<p>"The postman," said Helen. "<i>Possibly</i> there may
be a Christmas card for us."</p>

<p>It was for "us," but it was not a card. No; a
letter, addressed outside to Helen as the eldest, but
inside beginning "My six dear little nieces."</p>

<p>"From Aunt Ginevra," Helen exclaimed; "and
oh, she is coming home at last. And oh, oh, just
fancy, we are all to go to live with her. And&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Read it aloud," said Jinny quickly. But Helen
was all trembling with excitement. Jinny seized it
and read.</p>

<p>Delightful news truly for the six imprisoned
princesses!</p>

<p>"She <i>must</i> be nice," said Jinny; "she writes so
sweetly. And what can the presents be that she says
she is sending us for Christmas?"</p>

<p>Agatha looked over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"I have chosen what I think would have pleased
me most when I was a little girl. The box is sent
off by express from Paris, where your uncle and I
are resting for a few days, so that you may have it
by Christmas. And before the new year begins, my
darlings, I hope to be at last with you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Rat-tat-tat again. The railway van this time.
Such a big box comes up to the nursery. Dear, dear,
what a business to get it opened. How the six pairs
of eyes shine, how the six pairs of hands tremble
with eagerness as each undoes her own specially
marked parcel. And oh, the cries of delight at last!
What could be lovelier, what more perfect, than
the six exquisite dolls, each more beautiful than her
sisters!</p>

<p>"Real wax, real hair, real everysing," cries
Princess Baby.</p>

<p>"One suit of clothes ready, taking off and on ones,
and lots of stuff to make more," adds Butter-ball.</p>

<p>"Oh, how sweet Auntie must be, how happy we are
going to be!" cry all.</p>

<p>But Jinny's face is sad.</p>

<p>"My poor, ugly dolly," she murmurs. "And oh,
what shall I say if Auntie asks for my jug?"</p>

<p>"We'll tell her&mdash;all of us together. It was all for
our sakes you did it, and so she can't be angry," say
the other five.</p>

<p>"And, Jinny, I do think the old doll would make
a beautiful maid for the others; she really couldn't
look vulgar in a neat print frock and white apron."</p>

<p>Ginevra brightens up at this.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the same," she said, "I wish now we had
waited a little and believed that Auntie would come
as soon as she could. I see that it would have been
better. And oh, I do so hope she won't be vexed."</p>

<p>She was not vexed; only very, <i>very</i> sorry. More
deeply sorry than the princesses themselves could
understand.</p>

<p>"I had no idea of it all," said poor Auntie.
"Yet I could not have come to you sooner, my
darlings. Still&mdash;if I had known&mdash;&mdash; But it is all
over now, and you are going to be as happy as ever
your Auntie can make you."</p>

<p>"And it's <i>almost</i> the same as having a mamma,
isn't it?" said Baby, satisfied that in this possession
she had an undoubted share.</p>

<p>The mug was reclaimed. And the dealer, who had
paid far too little for it, was well frightened by no
less a person than Uncle himself.</p>

<p>Poor Red-Head never knew how he had failed.
But Auntie, who got to know his father and mother,
was able, without hurting his feelings, to make him
understand that little boys do well to keep out of
such transactions even when inspired by the kindest
of motives.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<h2>BASIL'S VIOLIN</h2>


<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">Thank</span> you so much for telling me about it. I
am pleased, for it is just what I wanted to hear of."</div>

<p>"And I am so glad for Herr Wildermann's sake.
It rarely happens in this world that one hears of a
want and a supply at the same time;" and the
speaker, laughing as she said the last words, shook
hands once again with her hostess and left her.</p>

<p>Lady Iltyd went to the window,&mdash;a low one, leading
on to the garden, and looked out. Then she
opened it and called out clearly, though not very
loudly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Basil, Basi&mdash;i&mdash;il, are you there, my boy?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; I'm coming." And from among
the bushes, at a very short distance, there emerged a
rather comical little figure. A boy of eight or nine,
with a bright rosy face and short dark hair. Over
his sailor suit he had a brown holland blouse, which
once, doubtless, had been clean, but was certainly so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
no longer. It stuck out rather bunchily behind,
owing to the large collar and handkerchief worn
beneath, and as the child was of a sturdy make
to begin with, and was extra flushed with his exertions,
it was no wonder that his mother stopped in
what she was going to say to laugh heartily at her
little boy.</p>

<p>"You look like a gnome, Basil," she said. "What
have you been doing to make yourself so hot and dirty?"</p>

<p>"Transplanting, mother. It's nearly done. I've
taken a lot of the little wood plants that I have in
my garden and put them down here among the big
shrubs, where it's cool and damp. It was too dry
and sunny for them in my garden, Andrew says.
They're used to the nice, shady, damp sort of places
in the wood, you see, mother."</p>

<p>"But it isn't the time for transplanting, Basil.
It is too late."</p>

<p>"It won't matter, Andrew says, mother. I've put
them in such a beautiful wet corner. But I'm
awfully hot, and I'm rather dirty."</p>

<p>"Rather," said his mother. "And, Basil, your
lessons for to-morrow? It's four o'clock, and you
know what your father said about having them
done before you come down to dessert."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Basil shook himself impatiently.</p>

<p>"Oh bother!" he said; "whenever I'm a little
happy somebody begins about something horrid.
I've such a lot of lessons to-day. And it's a half-holiday.
I think it is the greatest shame to call it
a half-holiday, and then give more lessons to do
than any other day."</p>

<p>At the bottom of her heart Lady Iltyd was a little
of Basil's opinion; but she felt it would do no good,
and might do a great deal of harm to say so. Basil
went as a day-scholar to a very good private school
at Tarnworth, the little country town two miles off.
He rode there on his pony in the morning, and rode
home again at four o'clock. He liked his schoolfellows,
and did not <i>dis</i>like his teachers, but he
could not bear lessons! There was this much excuse
for him, that he was not a clever boy in the
sense of learning quickly. On the contrary, he
learned slowly, and had to read a thing over several
times before he understood it. Sometimes he would
do so patiently enough; but sometimes&mdash;and these
"times," I fear, came more frequently than the good
ones&mdash;he was so <i>im</i>patient, so easily discouraged,
that it was not a pleasant task to superintend his
lessons' learning. Yet he was not without a queer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
kind of perseverance of his own&mdash;he could not bear to
go to bed leaving any of his lessons unfinished, and he
would go on working at them with a sort of dull,
hopeless resolution that was rather piteous, till one
reflected that, after all, he might just as well look
cheerful about it. But to look cheerful in the face
of difficulties was not Basil's "way." With the
first difficulty vanished all his brightness and good
temper, and all he could do was to work on like a
poor little over-driven slave, with no pleasure or
satisfaction in his task. And many an evening bedtime
was long past before his lessons were ready, for
though Basil well knew how long he took to learn
them, and how the later he put them off the harder
they grew, there was no getting him to set to work
at once on coming home. He would make one
excuse after another&mdash;"it was not worth while
beginning till after tea," or his little sister Blanche
had begged him to play with her just for five minutes,
and they "hadn't noticed how late it was," or&mdash;or&mdash;it
would be impossible to tell all the reasons why
Basil never could manage to begin his lessons
so as to get them done at a reasonable hour.
So that at last his father had made the rule of
which his mother reminded him&mdash;that he was not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to come down to dessert unless his lessons were
done.</p>

<p>Now, not coming down to dessert meant more to
Basil than it sounds, and nothing was a greater
punishment to him. It was not that he was too
fond of nice things, for he was not at all a greedy
boy, though he liked an orange, or a juicy pear, or a
macaroon biscuit as much as anybody, and he liked,
too, to be neatly dressed, and sit beside his father in
the pretty dining-room, by the nicely arranged table
with the flowers and the fruit and the sparkling
wine and shining glass. For though Basil was
not in some ways a clever child, he had great taste
for pretty and beautiful things. But it was none of
the things I have mentioned that made him so <i>very</i>
fond of "coming down to dessert." It was another
thing. It was his mother's playing on the piano.</p>

<p>Every evening when Lady Iltyd left the dining-room,
followed by Basil and Blanche, she used to go
straight to the grand piano which stood in one corner
of the library, where they generally sat, and there she
would play to the children for a quarter of an hour or
so, just whatever they asked for. She needed no
"music paper," as Blanche called it; the music seemed
to come out of her fingers of itself. And this was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Basil's happiest moment of the day. Blanche liked
it too, but not as much as Basil. She would sometimes
get tired of sitting still, and begin to fidget
about, so that now and then her mother would tell
her to run off to bed without waiting for nurse to
come for her. But not so Basil. There he would sit,&mdash;or
lie perhaps, generally on the white fluffy rug
before the fire,&mdash;with the soft dim light stealing in
through the coloured glass of the high windows, or
in winter evenings with no light but that of the
fire fitfully dancing on the rows and rows and <i>rows</i>
of books that lined the walls from floor to ceiling,
only varied here and there by the portrait of some
powdered-haired great-grandfather or grandmother
smiling, or sometimes, perhaps, frowning down on
their funny little descendant in his sailor-suit, with
his short-cropped, dark head. A quaint little figure
against the gleaming white fur, dreaming&mdash;what?&mdash;he
could not have told you, for he had not much
cleverness in telling what he thought. But his
music-dreams were very charming nevertheless, and
in after life, whenever anything beautiful or exquisite
came in his way, Basil's thoughts always flew back
to the old library and his mother's playing.</p>

<p><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Forlong'">For long</ins> he had imagined that nothing of music kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
could be more delightful. But a short time before
this little story begins a new knowledge had come
to him. At a concert at Tarnworth&mdash;for once or
twice a year there were good concerts at the little town&mdash;he
had heard a celebrated violinist play, and it
seemed to Basil as if a new world had opened to him.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said, when the concert was over,
looking up at his mother with red cheeks and sparkling
eyes, "it's better than the piano&mdash;that little
fiddle, I mean. It's like&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Like what, my boy?"</p>

<p>"I can't say it," said Basil, "but it's like as if the
music didn't belong to <i>here</i> at all. Like as if it
came out of the air someway, without notes or anything.
I think if I was an awfully clever man I could
say things out of a fiddle, far better than write them
in books."</p>

<p>His mother smiled at him.</p>

<p>"But you mustn't call it a fiddle, Basil. A violin
is the right name."</p>

<p>"Violin," repeated Basil thoughtfully. And a
few minutes later, when they were in the carriage
on their way home, "Mother," he said, "do you
think I might learn to play the violin?"</p>

<p>"I should like it very much," said his mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"But I fear there is no teacher at Tarnworth. I
will inquire, however. Only, Basil, there is one
thing. The violin is difficult, and you don't like
difficulties."</p>

<p>Basil opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Difficult," he said, and as he spoke he put up his
left arm as he had seen the violinist do, sawing the
air backwards and forwards with an imaginary bow
in his right&mdash;"difficult! I <i>can't</i> fancy it would be
difficult. But any way, I'd awfully like to learn it."</p>

<p>This had been two or three months ago. Lady
Iltyd had not forgotten Basil's wish; and, indeed, if
she had been inclined to do so, I don't think Basil
would have let her. For at least two or three times
a week he asked her if she had found a violin teacher
yet, and whether it wouldn't be a good plan to write
to London for a violin. For, at the bottom of his
heart, Basil had an idea which he did not quite like
to express, in the face of what his mother had said
as to the difficulty of violin playing, namely, that
teaching at all would be unnecessary!</p>

<p>"If I only had a violin in my arms," he used to
say to himself as he fiddled away with his invisible
bow, "I am <i>sure</i> I could make it sing out whatever
I wanted."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>And I am afraid that this idea of violin playing
which had taken such a hold of him, did not help
him to do his lessons any the quicker. He would
fall into a brown study in the middle of them, imagining
himself with the longed-for treasure in his
possession, and almost <i>hearing</i> the lovely sounds, to
wake up with a start to a half-finished Latin exercise
or French verb on the open copy-book before him,
so that it was really no wonder that the complaint,
evening after evening repeated, "Basil hasn't
finished his lessons," at last wore out his father's
patience.</p>

<p>We have been a long time of returning to the
garden and listening to the conversation between
Basil and his mother.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think it's a shame," repeated Basil,
<i>&agrave;propos</i> of Wednesday afternoon lessons.</p>

<p>"But it can't be altered," said his mother, "and
instead of wasting time in grumbling, I think it
would be much better to set to work. And Basil,
listen. If you really exert yourself to the utmost,
you may still get your lessons done in time this
evening. And if they <i>are</i> done in time, and you can
come down to dessert, I shall have something to tell
you in the library after dinner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Something to tell me," repeated Basil, looking
rather puzzled. "How do you mean, mother?
Something nice, do you mean?"</p>

<p>He did not take up ideas very quickly, and now
and then looked puzzled about things that would
have been easily understood by most children.</p>

<p>"Nice, of course it is nice, you stupid old fellow,"
said his mother, laughing. "Are you in a brown
study, Basil? That bodes ill for your lessons.
Come, rouse yourself and give <i>all</i> your attention to
them, and let me see a bright face at dessert. <i>Of
course</i> it is something 'nice' I have to tell you, or I
wouldn't make a bribe of it, would I? It's very
wrong to bribe you, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Basil. "I don't think it
can be if you do it. Kiss me, mother. I'll try to
do my lessons quickly," and lifting up his rosy face
for his mother's kiss, he ran off. "But oh, how I do
hate them!" he said to himself as he ran.</p>

<p>After all, "they" were not so very difficult to-day,
or perhaps Basil really did try hard for once. However
that may have been, the result was a happy
one. At dessert two bright little people made their
appearance in the dining-room, and before his
father had time to ask him the question he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
hitherto so dreaded, the boy burst out with the good
news&mdash;</p>

<p>"All done, father, every one, more than half an
hour ago."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Blanche complacently, "he's been
<i>werry</i> good. He's put his fingers in his ears, and
kept bumming to himself <i>such</i> a lot, and he hasn't
played the vi'lin one time."</p>

<p>"Played the violin!" repeated her father. "What
does she mean? You didn't tell me Basil had already
be&mdash;&mdash;" he went on, turning to the children's
mother; but she hastily interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Blanche means playing an imaginary violin,"
she said, smiling. "Ever since Basil heard Signor
L&mdash;&mdash; at Tarnworth, his head has been running on
violins so, that he stops in the middle of his lessons
to refresh himself with a little inaudible music."</p>

<p>As she spoke she got up and moved towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Bring your biscuits and fruit into the library,
children," she said. "You can eat them there.
I'm not going to play to you this evening. We're
going to talk instead."</p>

<p>Up jumped Basil.</p>

<p>"I don't want any fruit," he said, "I really don't.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Blanche, you stay with father and eat all you want.
I want to be a little while alone with mother in the
library. Mayn't I, mother?" he added coaxingly.
"Blanche doesn't mind."</p>

<p>"You are really very complimentary to <i>me</i>," said
his father, laughing. "Why should Blanche mind?"</p>

<p>"I doesn't," said Blanche, very contentedly watching
her father peeling a pear for her. So Basil and
his mother went off together for their talk.</p>

<p>"About the 'something nice,' mother?" began
Basil.</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, I'm quite ready to tell you.
Mrs. Marchcote was here to-day. You know who I
mean&mdash;the lady who lives in that pretty house at
the end of Tarnworth High Street. You pass it every
morning going to school."</p>

<p>"I know," said Basil, nodding his head. "But I
don't care about Mrs. Marchcote, mother. Is she
going to have a children's party&mdash;is that it? I don't
think I care about parties, mother." And his face
looked rather disappointed.</p>

<p>"Basil, Basil, how impatient you are! I never
said anything about a children's party. Mrs. Marchcote
told me something quite different from that.
Listen, Basil. A young German&mdash;Herr Wildermann<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is his name&mdash;has come to Tarnworth in hopes of
making his living by teaching the violin. He can
give pianoforte lessons also, but he plays the violin
better. He plays it, she says, <i>very</i> beautifully. He
has got no pupils yet, Basil. But&mdash;who do you think
is going to be his first one?"</p>

<p>Basil gazed at his mother. For a moment he felt
a little puzzled.</p>

<p>"Mother," he said at last, "do you mean&mdash;oh,
mother, <i>are</i> you going to let me have lessons? Shall
I have a dear little violin of my own? Oh, mother,
mother!"</p>

<p>And he jumped up from the rug where he had
been lying at his mother's feet, and looked as if he
were ready to turn head over heels for joy!</p>

<p>"Yes, my boy," said his mother; "you are going to
have your first lesson the day after to-morrow, and
Herr Wildermann is to choose you a violin. But
listen, Basil, and think well of what I say. It is <i>not</i>
easy to learn to play the violin. Even if a child
has a great deal of taste&mdash;talent even&mdash;for music, it
requires great patience and perseverance to learn to
play the violin at all well. No instrument requires
more patience before you can arrive at anything
really good. I would not say all this to another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
child&mdash;I would let Blanche, for instance, find out the
difficulties for herself, and meet them as they come,
cheerfully and brightly as she always does. But
you are so exaggerated about difficulties, Basil,
that I want to save yourself and me vexation and
trouble before you begin the violin. You are too
confident at first, and you cannot believe that there
will be difficulties, and then you go to the other extreme
and lose heart. Now, I warn you that the
violin is <i>very</i> difficult. And it is not a thing you <i>must</i>
learn&mdash;not like your lessons at school. It will be a
great, an immense pleasure to you once you master it,
but unless you resolve to be patient and persevering
and <i>hopeful</i> in learning it, you had better not begin it."</p>

<p>Lady Iltyd spoke very earnestly. She was
anxious to make an impression on Basil, for she
saw more clearly than any one the faults of his
character, and longed to help him to overcome them.
For a moment or two Basil remained silent, for he
was, as she had hoped he would be, struck by what
she had said, and was thinking over it. Then he
jumped up, and throwing his arms round his mother's
neck, kissed her very lovingly.</p>

<p>"Mother dear," he said, "I do want to learn it,
and I will try. Even if it is very difficult, I'll try.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
You'll see if I won't, for I do love music, and I love
<i>you</i>, mother. And I would like to please you."</p>

<p>Lady Iltyd kissed him in return.</p>

<p>"My own dear boy," she said, "you will please
me very much if you overcome that bad habit of
losing heart over difficulties."</p>

<p>"He may learn more things than music in learning
the violin," she thought to herself.</p>

<p>But as Basil went upstairs to bed, fiddling at his
invisible violin all the way, and whistling the tune
he liked to fancy he was playing, <i>he</i> said to himself:
"I do mean to try, but I <i>can't</i> believe it is so difficult
as mother says."</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Part II</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">That</span> same afternoon an elderly woman was sitting
alone by the window of a shabby little parlour over
a grocer's shop in the High Street of Tarnworth.
She had a gentle, careworn face&mdash;a face that looked
as if its owner had known much sorrow, but had
not lost heart and patience. She was knitting&mdash;knitting
a stocking, but so deftly and swiftly that it
was evident she did not need to pay any attention
to what her fingers were doing. Her eyes,&mdash;soft, old,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
blue eyes, with the rather sad look those clear blue
eyes often get in old age,&mdash;gazed now and then out
of the window&mdash;for from where she sat a corner of
the ivy-covered church tower was to be seen making
a pleasant object against the sky&mdash;and now and
then turned anxiously towards the door.</div>

<p>"He is late, my poor Ulric," she said to herself.
"And yet I almost dread to see him come in, with
the same look on his face&mdash;always the same sad
disappointment! Ah, what a mistake it has been,
I fear, this coming to England&mdash;but yet we did it
for the best, and it seemed so likely to succeed here
where there are two or three such good schools and
no music teacher. We did it for the best, however,
and there is no use regretting it. The good God
sees fit to try us&mdash;but still we must trust Him.
Ah, if it were only I, but my poor boy!"</p>

<p>And the old eyes filled with slow-coming tears.</p>

<p>They were hastily brushed away, however, for at
that moment the door opened and a young man,
breathless with excitement, hurried into the room.</p>

<p>"Mother!" he exclaimed, but before he could say
more she interrupted him.</p>

<p>"What is it, my boy? What is it, Ulric?" she
exclaimed. "No bad news, surely?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bad news, mother dear? I scarcely see what
more bad news <i>could</i> come to us. As long as we
have each other, what is there for us to lose? But
I did not mean to speak gloomily this morning, for
I have brought you <i>good</i> news. Fancy, mother, only
fancy&mdash;I have got a pupil at last."</p>

<p>"My Ulric&mdash;that <i>is</i> good news!" said poor Frau
Wildermann.</p>

<p>"And who knows what it may lead to," said the
young man. "I have always heard that the <i>first</i>
pupil is the difficulty&mdash;once started, one gets on
rapidly. Especially if the pupil is one likely to do
one credit, and I fancy this will be the case with this
boy. Mrs. Marchcote&mdash;it is through her kindness I
have been recommended&mdash;says he has unusual taste
for music. He has been longing to learn the violin."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>"The son of Sir John Iltyd&mdash;one of the principal
families here. I could not have a better introduction.
I am to go the day after to-morrow&mdash;three lessons a
week, and well paid."</p>

<p>He went on to explain all about the terms to his
mother, who listened with a thankful heart, as she
saw Ulric's bright eyes and eager, hopeful expression.</p>

<p>"He has not looked like that for many a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
day," she thought to herself, "and the help has not
come too soon. Ulric would have been even more
unhappy had he known how very little we have
left."</p>

<p>And she felt glad that she had struggled on without
telling her son quite the worst of things. What
would she not have borne for him&mdash;how had she not
struggled for him all these years? He was the only
one left her, the youngest and last of her children,
for the other three had died while still almost infants,
and Ulric had come to them when she and her
husband were no longer young, and had lost hopes
of ever having a child to cheer their old age. So
never was a son more cherished. And he deserved
it. He had been the best of sons, and had tried in
his boyish way to replace his father, though he was
only twelve years old when that father died. Since
then life had been hard on them both, doubly hard,
for each suffered for the other even more than personally,
and yet in another sense not so hard as if
either had been alone. They had had misfortune
after misfortune&mdash;the little patrimony which had
enabled Frau Wildermann to yield to Ulric's darling
wish of being a musician by profession, had been
lost by a bad investment just as his musical education<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was completed, and it seemed too late in the
day for him to try anything else. And so for a year
or two they had struggled on, faring not so badly in
the summer when living is cheaper, and Ulric often
got engagements for the season in the band at some
watering-place, but suffering sadly in the long, cold
German winters&mdash;suffering as those do who will
not complain, who keep up a respectable appearance
to the last. And then came the idea of emigrating
to England, suggested to them by a friend
who had happened to hear of what seemed like an
opening at Tarnworth, where they had now been for
nearly two months without finding any pupils for
Ulric, or employment of any kind in his profession
for the young musician.</p>

<p>So it is easy to understand the delight with which
he accepted Lady Iltyd's proposal, made to him by
Mrs. Marchcote.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to say which of the two,
master or pupil, looked forward the more eagerly to
the first music-lesson. Basil dreamed of it night
and day. Herr Wildermann on his side built castles
in the air about the number of pupils he was to have,
and the fame he was to gain through his success
with Lady Iltyd's boy. Poor fellow, it was not from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
vanity that his mind dwelt on and so little doubted
this same wonderful success!</p>

<p>And in due course came the day after to-morrow,
neither hastened nor retarded by the eagerness with
which it was looked forward to.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful home! The child cannot but
be refined and tender in nature who has been brought
up in such a home," thought Herr Wildermann,
ready at all times to think the best, and more than
usually inclined to-day to see things through rose-coloured
spectacles.</p>

<p>He was walking up the long avenue of elms,
leading to the Hall. The weather was lovely, already
hot, however, and he would have liked to take off
his hat and let the breeze&mdash;what there was of it,
that is to say&mdash;play on his forehead. But he had
not a free hand, for he was loaded with no less than
three violins, his own and two others, what are called
half and three-quarters sized, as, till he saw his
little pupil, he could not tell which would suit him.
He did look rather a comical object, I daresay, to
the tall footman at the door, but not so to the eager
child who had spent the last hour at least in peeping
out to see if his master was not yet coming.</p>

<p>"Mother," he exclaimed, rushing back into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
room, "he's come. And he's brought loads of
violins."</p>

<p>"<i>Loads</i>," repeated Lady Iltyd, smiling down at
her boy, whose rosy cheeks and bright eyes were
still rosier and brighter than usual; "well, among
them it is to be hoped there will be one to suit you."</p>

<p>Then she turned to Ulric, who was standing in
the doorway, half dazzled by the brightness of the
pretty room into which he was ushered after the
darker hall, and still more confused by his intense
anxiety to please the graceful lady who was greeting
him so kindly, and to win the liking of the child he
was to teach. But Basil's mother's pleasant manner
soon set him at his ease, and in a minute or two he
was opening the violin cases and discussing which
would be the right size for the boy. Basil gazed
and listened in silence. At the first glance Herr
Wildermann had felt a little disappointed. His new
pupil was not certainly a poetical looking child!
His short sturdy figure and round rosy face
spoke of the perfection of hearty boyish life, but
nothing more. But his breathless eagerness, the
intense interest in his eyes&mdash;most of all the look in
his face as he listened to a little caprice which Ulric
played on his own violin as a sort of introduction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to the lesson, soon made the musician change his
opinion.</p>

<p>"He has it&mdash;he has the musician's soul. One can
see it!" he half said, half whispered to Lady Iltyd,
though he had the good sense to understand what
might have seemed a little cold in her answer.</p>

<p>"I think Basil truly loves music," she said, "but
you will join with me, I am sure, Herr Wildermann,
in telling him that to be a musician at all, to play
<i>well</i> above all, takes much patience and perseverance.
Nothing in this world can be done without trouble,
can it?"</p>

<p>"Ah no," said Herr Wildermann, "that is true."</p>

<p>But Basil, whose fingers were fidgeting to touch
at last the violin and dainty bow, said nothing.</p>

<p>"I will leave you," said his mother. "I think
you will find it better to be alone with Basil, Herr
Wildermann."</p>

<p>And she left the room.</p>

<p>She listened with some anxiety to the sounds
which now and then made their way to the room
where she sat writing. Sweet clear sounds occasionally
from the master's violin, but mingled, it
must be confessed, with others the reverse of
musical. Squeakings and gruntings, and a dreadful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
sort of scraping whine, not to be described in
words.</p>

<p>"My poor Basil," thought his mother, though it
was a little difficult not to smile at a <i>most</i> unearthly
shriek that just then reached her ears. "I hope he
is not losing his temper already."</p>

<p>But she waited quietly till the sounds ceased.
Then came the soft sweet notes of a melody which
she knew well, played by Herr Wildermann alone;
and a few minutes after she saw among the trees the
tall thin figure of the young German, laden with but
two violins this time as he made his way down the
avenue.</p>

<p>She waited a minute or two to see if Basil would
come to her. Then, as he did not, she returned to
the morning room where he had had his lesson. He
was still there, standing by the window, but she was
pleased to hear as she went in that he was humming
to himself the air that Ulric had played last.</p>

<p>"Well, Basil?" she said, "and how did you
get on?"</p>

<p>The boy turned round&mdash;there was a mixture of
expressions on his face. A rather dewy look about
his eyes made his mother wonder for a moment if
he had been crying. But when he spoke it was so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
cheerfully that she thought she must have been
mistaken.</p>

<p>"He plays <i>so</i> beautifully, mother," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I knew he did. I heard
him one day at Mrs. Marchcote's, and I listened this
morning."</p>

<p>"You listened, mother?" he said. "Did you hear
how awfully it squeaked with me?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Lady Iltyd, in a matter-of-fact
way; "it is always so at first."</p>

<p>Basil seemed relieved.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "<i>he</i> said so too. But I don't
mind. He says I shall very soon be able to make
it sound prettily&mdash;to get nice <i>sounds</i>, you know, even
before I can play tunes, if&mdash;&mdash;" and Basil hesitated.</p>

<p>"If what?"</p>

<p>"If I practise a lot. But I think I shall. It's
rather fun after all, and I do so like to have that
ducky little violin in my arms. It does feel so jolly,"
and he turned with sparkling eyes again to the dainty
little case containing his new treasure.</p>

<p>His mother was pleased. The first brunt of disappointment
which she was sure Basil had felt,
whether he owned to it or not, had passed off better
than she had expected.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 352px;">
<img src="images/i118.png" width="352" height="600" alt="BASIL&#39;S VIOLIN" title="BASIL&#39;S VIOLIN" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>And for some days his energy continued. At all
hours, when the boy was at home, unearthly squeaks
and shrieks were to be heard in various parts of the
house, for it was not at all Basil's way to confine his
practisings to his own quarters. Anywhere that came
handy&mdash;on the staircase, in the pantry, when he took
it into his head to pay a visit to the footmen, the
boy and his violin were to be seen at all sorts of odd
hours, and alas, still more surely to be <i>heard!</i> For
a while his mother thought it best not to interfere,
she did not wish to check his ardour, and the second
and third lessons went off, as far as she could judge,
very well. But gradually the violin grew less talkative&mdash;a
day, then a couple of days, then even longer,
passed without its voice being heard, and one day,
towards the close of the fifth or sixth lesson, Lady
Iltyd, going into the room, saw a look she knew too
well on her little son's face. He flung down the
violin and turned to Herr Wildermann&mdash;</p>

<p>"I <i>can't</i> play any more&mdash;nasty thing&mdash;I believe
it's got a bad fairy inside it," he said, half in fun,
half in petulance.</p>

<p>"Why, Basil&mdash;&mdash;" began his mother, but her glance
happening at the moment to fall on the young
German, she stopped short, startled at the look of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
intense distress that overspread his features. "He
thinks I shall blame <i>him</i>, poor fellow," she thought,
and, with her quick kindliness, she tried, indirectly,
to reassure him.</p>

<p>"Don't look so grave about this silly little boy,
Herr Wildermann," she said brightly. "Suppose
you drive away the bad fairy by playing to us, and
let lazy Basil rest a little."</p>

<p>Basil's face, which had clouded over at the beginning
of this speech, brightened up again. He flung
himself down on the rug with the air of one intending
to enjoy himself. And for the next ten minutes
or so not a sound was heard but the exquisite tones
of the master's violin, thrilling with intensity, then
warbling like a bird in the joyous spring-time, bringing
the tears to the boy's eyes with its tender pathos,
and then flushing his cheeks with excitement, till at
last they died away in the distance as it were, as if returning
to the enchanted land from whence they came.</p>

<p>Basil gave a deep sigh.</p>

<p>"Ah," he said, in a low voice, "to play like
<i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Herr Wildermann's face lighted up.</p>

<p>"He <i>has</i> it&mdash;he loves it so much, madame," he
said half apologetically to Lady Iltyd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," she said, but her tone was rather grave.
"But it is not enough to love it. He must learn not
to be so easily discouraged. You know, my boy,
what I said to you at the beginning," she went
on, turning to Basil, "it is not a <i>necessity</i> to learn
the violin. I would rather you gave it up than
make it a worry and vexation to yourself and
others."</p>

<p>Basil stopped her with a kiss.</p>

<p>"It's only when the bad fairy comes," he said.
"Don't be vexed with me, mother. I'm in a beautiful
good temper now."</p>

<p>A day or two after this, Basil's mother left home
for a fortnight. She said a few words to him before
she went, about his violin lessons, but not much, for
she had heard him practising again with more attention,
and she had begun to hope his impatience and
discouragement had been merely a passing fit. So
she only repeated to him what she had said already.
Basil listened in silence, with an expression on his
face she did not quite understand. But she thought
it better to say no more, especially when the boy
flung his arms round her neck, and repeated more
than once&mdash;</p>

<p>"I do want to please you, little mother; I do, I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
do," he cried; and her last sight of him, as the carriage
drove away, was standing with his violin in
his arms at the hall-door, pretending to fiddle away
at a great rate.</p>

<p>"He is only a baby, after all," said Lady Iltyd to
herself. "I must not be too anxious about his faults.
This fortnight will test his perseverance about the
violin. If he is not going to be steady about it, he
must give it up."</p>

<p>Alas! the fortnight tested Basil and found him
wanting. There were some excuses perhaps. It
was very hot, and the half-yearly examinations were
coming on. In his parents' absence it had been
arranged that he was to stay later at school so as to
get his lessons done before coming home&mdash;a very
necessary precaution; for without his mother at
hand to keep him up to his work, it is to be doubted
if the lessons would often have been finished before
midnight! Basil would not have gone to bed and
left them undone&mdash;that was not his way; but he
would have wasted three hours over what with
energy and cheerfulness might have been well done
in one. At school, under the eye of a master, this
was less likely to occur&mdash;the boy was to some extent
<i>forced</i> to give his attention and keep up his spirit,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
though the master, whose business it was to superintend
the lessons preparing, found his labours increased
in no trifling way during the fortnight of
Basil's staying later.</p>

<p>And when he got home after all this hard work,
the boy felt inclined for a romp with Blanche, or a
stroll in the garden, far more than for practising the
violin! Half-holidays, too, in hot weather, presented
many temptations. The hay was down in the park
on the side nearest the house, the strawberries were
at their prime; there seemed always something else
to do than struggling with the capricious little instrument,
whose "contrariness," as he called it,
really made Basil sometimes fancy it was bewitched.</p>

<p>"You've got it inside you; why won't you let it
come out for me as well as for him?" he would say,
addressing his violin, half in fun, half in petulance,
after some vain but not very sustained effort to draw
out of it tones in any way approaching those which
in Herr Wildermann's hands seemed to come of
themselves. "No, I've no patience with you. It's
too bad," and down he would fling violin and bow,
declaring to himself he would never touch them
again. But when the day for the music lesson came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
round, and Herr Wildermann drew out some few
lovely notes before Basil was ready to begin, all the
boy's impatience disappeared, and he listened as if
entranced till his master recalled his attention. And
thus, seeing the child's undoubted love for music,
Ulric could not yet feel altogether discouraged,
though again there were times when he doubted if
his efforts would ever succeed in making a musician
of the boy.</p>

<p>"But as long as he likes it so much," he
would say to himself, "and provided he does not
<i>wish</i> to give it up, it would be wrong of me to
suggest it. In any case it is for his mother to
judge."</p>

<p>Before the fortnight was over, however, Herr
Wildermann's patience was sorely tried. There
came a day on which, with a sudden outburst of
temper, Basil refused to try any more, and only by
dint of promising to play to him for a quarter of an
hour after the lesson was over, could his master get
him to make any effort. Nor was it worth much
when made.</p>

<p>And poor Ulric walked home that day to the
little lodging over the grocer's shop with a heavy
heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Part III</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">In</span> the first pleasant excitement of her return
home and finding the children well, and to all appearance
happy, Lady Iltyd did not think of what
had, nevertheless, been often in her mind during her
absence&mdash;namely, Basil's violin!</div>

<p>But the day after, when he came back from
school and was beginning to tell her all he had been
busied about while she was away, the question soon
came to her lips, "And what about your violin, my boy?"</p>

<p>Basil hesitated&mdash;then his rosy face grew rosier
than before, and he stood first upon one leg and then
upon the other, a habit of his when not quite easy
in his mind.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Lady Iltyd.</p>

<p>Then out it came.</p>

<p>"Mother," he began, "I didn't like to tell you
yesterday just when you first came back, but I was
going to tell you. I know you'll be vexed, but I
must tell you the truth. I haven't got on a bit&mdash;I
tried to practise at first, but I <i>can't</i> get to play, and
I hate it&mdash;I mean I hate not being able to play&mdash;and
please, mother, I want to leave it off."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>A rather sad look came over Lady Iltyd's face,
but she only said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, Basil. You have quite made up
your mind, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied. "You know you always said,
mother, I needn't go on with it if I didn't&mdash;if it was
too difficult," for he could not truthfully say "if I
didn't care for it."</p>

<p>"Yes. I told you it was no <i>necessity</i>. Very well,
then, I will tell Herr Wildermann to-morrow."</p>

<p>"But, mother," Basil hesitated, "I didn't want
you to be vexed about it."</p>

<p>"I am not <i>vexed</i>," his mother replied. "My disappointment
is another matter. But I will keep to
what I said. It is better for you to give it up than
to make a trouble of it to yourself and others. Now
run away, for I am busy."</p>

<p>Basil went out of the room slowly, and not feeling
altogether happy in his mind. "It isn't fair
of mother," he said to himself; "she told me I
needn't go on with it if I didn't like, and she never
said she'd be vexed if I gave it up, and she is
vexed." But he would not remember how much
and often his mother had warned him before he
began, how she had told him of the patience and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
perseverance required, and how he had refused to
believe her! And, boy-like, he soon forgot all about
it in a game with Blanche and the dogs in the
garden, or remembered it only with a feeling of
relief that he need not cut short his play to go in to
practise his unlucky violin. But a remark of his
little sister's rather destroyed his equanimity.</p>

<p>"I'm going in now, Basil," she said with the
little "proper" air she sometimes put on; "I've not
finished my scales yet, and I won't have time after
tea. And you should go in for your violin, Basil.
Come along."</p>

<p>"No," said Basil, rolling himself again lazily on
the smooth lawn; "I'm not going to bother with it
any more. I've given it up."</p>

<p>Blanche's eyes opened wide.</p>

<p>"Oh, Basil!" she exclaimed. "How sorry mother
will be!"</p>

<p>"Rubbish," said Basil, roughly. "Mother always
said I might leave it off if I liked. I don't want
you to preach to me, Blanche." Upon which Blanche
walked away, her little person erect with offended
dignity.</p>

<p>Basil did not feel happy, but he called the dogs to
him and went off whistling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>The next day was a half-holiday. Basil came
home at mid-day, and the violin lesson was in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>"Am I to have a lesson to-day, mother?" said
the boy at luncheon.</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann is coming," replied his
mother, "it would be very rude to let him come for
nothing. I will see him first, and then you can go
to him for the hour. If he likes to play to you
instead of your having a lesson, I do not care. It
does not signify <i>now</i>."</p>

<p>The idea would have been very much to Basil's
taste, but the tone in which his mother said that
"now," made him again feel vexed. He tried to
fancy he had cause for being so, for he would not
own to the real truth&mdash;that he was vexed with himself,
and that "himself" deserved it.</p>

<p>"It isn't fair," he repeated half sullenly.</p>

<p>Two hours later he was summoned to the library.
Herr Wildermann had come fully a quarter of an
hour before&mdash;he had heard his ring, and he knew
his mother was in the drawing-room waiting for him.
When he entered the library he thought at first there
was no one there&mdash;the violin cases lay open on the
table, the music-stand was placed ready as usual;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but that was all. No pleasant voice met him with
a friendly greeting in broken English and words of
kindly encouragement.</p>

<p>"Can Herr Wildermann have gone already?"
thought the boy. "He might have waited to say
good-bye. What did Sims call me for if he had
gone?"</p>

<p>And he was turning to leave the room with a
mixture of feelings&mdash;irritation and some disappointment,
mingled nevertheless with a certain sense of
relief, for he had dreaded this last lesson&mdash;when a
slight, a very slight sound seeming to come from
somewhere near the windows, caught his ear. He
had come into the room more softly than his wont,
and his footfall had made no sound on the thick
carpet. The person who was hidden by the curtains
had not heard him, had no idea any one was in the
room, for through a sort of half-choked sob the child
heard two or three confused words which, though
uttered in German, were easy enough to understand&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mother, ah, my poor mother! How can I tell
her? Oh, my mother!"</p>

<p>And startled and shocked, Basil stopped short in
the question that was on his lips. "Who's there?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Is it you, Blanche?" he had been on the point of
saying, when the words caught his ears.</p>

<p>"It must be Herr Wildermann&mdash;can he be
<i>crying?</i>" said Basil to himself, his cheeks growing
red as the idea struck him. "What should
I do?"</p>

<p>He had no time to consider the question, for as
he stood in perplexity his little dog Yelpie, who had
followed him into the room, suddenly becoming
aware of the state of things, dashed forward with
a short sharp bark.</p>

<p>"Yelpie&mdash;Yelpie," cried Basil; "be quiet, Yelpie.
It's only Herr Wildermann. Don't you know him,
Yelpie? What a stupid you are!"</p>

<p>He went on talking fast to give the young German
time to recover himself, for, on hearing Basil's
voice, Ulric had come forward from the shelter of the
curtains. He was not red, but pale,&mdash;very pale,
with a look of such intense misery in his eyes, that
Basil's momentary feeling of contempt entirely faded
into one of real anxiety and sympathy.</p>

<p>"Are you ill, Herr Wildermann? You look so
strange. Is your mother ill? Is anything dreadful
the matter?" he asked hurriedly, pressing forward
nearer to the young man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Ulric tried to smile, but it was a poor attempt, and
he felt that it was so. Suddenly a sort of weak, faint
feeling came over him&mdash;he had walked over to the
Park in the full heat of the day, and the meals that
were eaten over the grocer's shop were very frugal!&mdash;he
had not been prepared for the news that had met
him. "Could I&mdash;might I have a glass of water,
Master Basil?" he said, drawing to him a chair and
dropping into it.</p>

<p>"I'll ring for&mdash;no, stay, I'll fetch it myself," said
Basil, with quick understanding. "I shouldn't like
the servants to know he had been <i>crying</i>&mdash;poor man,"
he thought to himself as he left the room. And in
two minutes he was back with a glass of wine and
water.</p>

<p>"I made Sims put some sherry in it," he said half
apologetically. "You've knocked yourself up somehow,
Herr Wildermann, haven't you?"</p>

<p>And Ulric drank obediently, and managed this time
to smile more successfully. "How kind and thoughtful
the boy was&mdash;how could he be the cause of such
sorrow, if indeed he understood it!" thought the
young man to himself.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;yes&mdash;perhaps it was the hot sun," he said
confusedly, as he put down the glass. "Thank you,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
very much. I am all right now. Had we not better
begin? Not that I am hurried," he went on. "I
can stay a full hour from now. I have no engagements&mdash;nothing
to hurry me home," he added sadly,
for in his heart he was thinking how he dreaded the
return home, and what he would have to tell his poor
old mother.</p>

<p>"But what's the matter?" persisted Basil, who, now
that the ice was broken, felt inclined to get to the
bottom of things. "What are you so troubled about&mdash;what
were you&mdash;&mdash;?" He hesitated and stopped short,
and again his rosy cheeks grew redder than usual.</p>

<p>Herr Wildermann looked up. He was still very
pale, but he did not seem self-conscious or ashamed.</p>

<p>"You saw my distress?" he said quietly. "Ah,
well, I could not help it&mdash;the thought of my poor
mother&mdash;&mdash;" He turned away and bit his lips. "I
thought you knew the cause of it," he went on;
"your lady mother, did you not know&mdash;did she not
tell you that she meant to-day to give me notice that
the lessons are to cease&mdash;that this is to be the last?"</p>

<p>Basil opened his mouth as if he meant to say
something, and stood there, forgetting to shut it
again, and staring up in Ulric's face, though no
words came. Ulric, after waiting a moment or two,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
turned away and began arranging the violins.
Then at last the boy ejaculated&mdash;</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann, you&mdash;you don't mean to
say&mdash;&mdash;" and stopped short again.</p>

<p>"To say what?" asked the young German, but
without much tone of interest in his voice. He had
quite mastered himself by now&mdash;a sort of dull, hopeless
resignation was coming over him&mdash;it did not
seem to matter what Basil said about it; it was all
settled, and the momentary gleam of good-fortune
which had so raised his hopes had faded into the
dark again. "We must go back to Germany," he
was saying to himself. "Somehow or other I must
scrape together money enough to take my mother
back to her own country. There at least she need
not starve. I can earn our daily bread, even if I
have to give up music for ever."</p>

<p>But again Basil's voice interrupted his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann," said the boy, speaking now
with eagerness, and throwing aside his hesitation,
"is it possible that it is about my lessons that you're
unhappy? Does it <i>matter</i> to you if I give them up?
I never thought of it."</p>

<p>"Master Basil," said the young man sadly, "it
does not signify now. It is all settled. But I do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
not blame you. It is not your fault&mdash;at least, it is
not exactly your fault. You are so young, and the
violin is very difficult. I am sorry to lose you as a
pupil, for I think you could have learnt well, if you
had had more hopefulness and perseverance."</p>

<p>And again he turned away as if there were no more
to be said.</p>

<p>But Basil was not to be so easily satisfied.</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann," he exclaimed, going nearer
to his master and pulling him gently by the sleeve,
"that can't be all. I daresay you're vexed at my
giving it up when you've tried so hard to teach me,
but that wouldn't make you so <i>dreadfully</i> sorry.
Herr Wildermann, do tell me all about it? Is it
because&mdash;because of the money?" he whispered at
last. "Are you so&mdash;does it matter so much?"</p>

<p>Ulric turned his pale face to the boy. Its expression
was still sad&mdash;very sad, but quiet and
resigned.</p>

<p>"Yes, my child," he said composedly. "Why
should I hide it? There is no shame in it&mdash;yes, it
is because of the money. We are <i>very</i> poor. And
also I had hoped much from giving you lessons. I
thought if I succeeded as I expected it would have
brought me other pupils."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Basil gazed up in the young man's face for a
moment or two without speaking. He did not take in
ideas very quickly, and perhaps he had never before
in his life thought so seriously as at this moment.</p>

<p>"I see," he said at last. "I did not understand
before. If I had known&mdash;but even now it is not
too late, Herr Wildermann. I need not give up
my lessons. I will ask mother to let me go on
with them, and you will see she will agree in a
moment."</p>

<p>A gleam of pleasure lighted up Ulric's pale face,
but it faded almost as quickly as it had come.</p>

<p>"Thank you for your kind thought, my little
friend," he said; "but what you propose would not
be right. It would not be right for your mother
to pay me money for teaching you when she had
decided that she did not want me to teach you any
more. It would be a mere charity to me&mdash;it would
be more honest for me to ask for charity at once,"
he went on, the colour mounting to his face. "No,
Basil, it could not be; but thank you as much.
Now let us go on with our lesson."</p>

<p>Basil understood, but was not satisfied. The
lesson passed quietly. Never had the boy so
thoroughly given his attention, or tried so hard to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
overcome the difficulties which had so disheartened
him.</p>

<p>"It is too bad," he said to himself; "but it is all
my own fault. I believe I could have got on if I
had really tried. And now it is too late. He
wouldn't give me lessons now, for he would think it
was only for him."</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea struck him.</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann," he said, "won't you do
<i>this?</i> Suppose I ask for just six lessons more, and
I <i>will</i> try. You'll see if I don't. Well, after these
six, if I'm not getting on any better, it'll be given up.
But if I am, and if I really <i>want</i> to go on, you won't
think it's not right, will you?"</p>

<p>Ulric hesitated.</p>

<p>"No," he said; "I have no scruples in going on
teaching you, for I feel certain you could learn well
if you were more hopeful. But you must explain it
all to your mother, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped
short, and then went on resolutely. "I will not be
ashamed. It is for my mother&mdash;anything for her.
It was only the feeling, my boy&mdash;but perhaps you
are too young to understand&mdash;the feeling that it was
almost like asking charity."</p>

<p>"I do understand," exclaimed Basil, "and I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
think I need tell mother <i>yet</i>, Herr Wildermann. I
don't want to promise again, and perhaps not keep
my promise. I'll just ask for the six lessons, and
tell mother I can't tell her why just yet. And then
think how surprised she'll be if I really do get on;"
and the boy's eyes sparkled with delight. But to
Ulric's there came tears of thankfulness.</p>

<p>If Lady Iltyd suspected in part what had worked
the change in Basil's ideas and prompted his request,
she was too wise to say so. His petition for six
lessons more was granted willingly, but not lightly.</p>

<p>"Do you really mean to profit by them, Basil?"
she asked. "If so, I am only too willing that you
should go on and give yourself a fair trial."</p>

<p>"That is it, mother," said the boy eagerly, "I
want to see, to try if I can't do better. At least that
is <i>partly</i> it," he went on, for he had already told her
that he could not explain the whole just yet.</p>

<p>So poor Ulric Wildermann went home with a
lighter heart than he had expected. He hoped much
from these six lessons, for it was evident that Basil
meant to put his heart into them.</p>

<p>"I need not tell my mother of my fears," thought
Ulric to himself, "for they may, after all, prove to
be only fears, and what would be the use of making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
her miserable in such a case?" And he was so
bright and cheerful that evening in the little sitting-room
over the grocer's shop, that even his mother's
eyes failed to discover that he had had more than
usual anxiety that day.</p>

<p>One week, two weeks, three weeks passed. It
was the day of the last of the six lessons.</p>

<p>"Mother," said Basil that morning when he was
starting for school. "I have my violin lesson this
afternoon when I come home, you know. Herr
Wildermann told me to ask you if you would come
in to-day while I am playing. Not at the beginning,
please, but about half-way through. He wants
you to see if I am getting on better," and then, with
a very happy kiss, he was off.</p>

<p>Lady Iltyd had left Basil quite to himself about
his violin these last weeks. She had not <i>heard</i> much
of his practising, but she had noticed that he got his
school lessons done quickly and without needing to
be reminded, and then regularly disappeared in his
own quarters, and she had her private hopes and
expectations.</p>

<p>Nor were they disappointed. What cannot be
done with patience and cheerfulness? Those three
weeks had seen more progress made than the three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
months before, and Basil's eyes danced with pleasure
when he left off playing and stood waiting to hear
what his mother would say.</p>

<p>She said nothing, but she drew him to her and
kissed him tenderly, and Basil, peeping up half shyly&mdash;for
somehow, as he told Blanche afterwards,
"mother's <i>pleased</i> kisses" always made him feel a
little shy&mdash;saw a glimmer of tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You <i>are</i> pleased, mother?" he whispered, and
another kiss was the answer. Then the young
stranger came forward.</p>

<p>"Herr Wildermann, I must thank you for all the
trouble you have taken. I am more than pleased,"
said Lady Iltyd warmly. "How have you succeeded
so well? You have taught him more than his music&mdash;you
have taught him to persevere, and to keep
up heart in spite of difficulties."</p>

<p>"He has taught himself, madame," said Ulric
eagerly, his face flushing. "It was his kind heart
that gave him what he needed. Ah, Master Basil,"
he went on, turning to his little pupil, "I must now
tell the whole, and then it will be to say if you are
still to continue your lessons."</p>

<p>"The whole" was soon told, and it is easy to understand
that it did not lessen Lady Iltyd's pleasure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
She had been glad to find her boy capable of real
effort and determination&mdash;she was still more glad to
find that the new motive which had prompted these
was unselfish sympathy and kindness.</p>

<p>"I thank you <i>again</i>, Herr Wildermann," she said,
when the young man had told her all, "you have, as
I said, taught Basil more lessons than you knew.
And your mother is happy to have so good a son."</p>

<p>Better days began for the young music-master.
Thanks to Basil's mother and to Basil himself, for
the boy became a pupil who would have done credit
to any master, Herr Wildermann gradually made his
way in the neighbourhood he had chosen for his new
home, and his old mother's later days were passed in
peace and comfort. He always counted Tarnworth
his home, though as time went on he came to be
well known as one of the first violinists of the day,
in London and others of the great capitals of Europe.</p>

<p>But sometimes when his success and popularity
were at the highest, he would turn to the friend who
had been his first pupil, and say half regretfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>You</i> might excel me if you chose, Basil. I
could sometimes find it in my heart to wish that you
too had been born a poor boy with his way to make
in the world."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>And Basil Iltyd would laugh as he told Uric that
his affection made him over-estimate his pupil's
talent.</p>

<p>"Though, such as it is," he added, "I have to
thank you for having drawn it out, and added untold
pleasure to my life."</p>

<p>For though Basil had too many other duties to
attend to for it to be possible for him to devote very
much time to music, he never neglected it, and never
forgot the gratitude he owed his mother for encouraging
his boyish taste.</p>

<p>"Above all," Lady Iltyd used often to say, "as
in mastering the violin, you gained your first battle
over impatience and want of perseverance."</p>

<p>"My first but not my last," he would answer
brightly. For Basil came to be known for steady,
cheerful determination, which, after all, is worth
many more brilliant gifts in the journey through
life, which to even the most fortunate is uphill and
rugged and perplexing at times.</p>

<h2>THE MISSING BON-BONS</h2>

<h3>A TRUE STORY</h3>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span></h3>

<div class='poem'>
"Let it either be grave or glad<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If only it may be true."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear</span> me, such a lot of children! At first you could
hardly have believed that they were all brothers and
sisters&mdash;such a number there seemed, and several
so nearly of a size. There were&mdash;let me see&mdash;two,
three, four, actually five girls of varying heights, the
two elder, twins apparently, for in all respects they
resembled each other so closely; three or four boys,
too, from Jack of fourteen to little hop-o'-my-thumb
Chris of six. There they were all together in the
large empty playroom at Landell's Manor, dancing,
jumping, shouting, as only a roomful of perfectly
healthy children, under the influence of some unusual
and delightful excitement, can dance, and jump,
and shout.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></div>

<p>"Miss Campbell's coming to-day&mdash;joy, joy!" exclaimed
one or two of the little girls.</p>

<p>"Miss Campbell is coming, hurrah, hurrah!" sang
Jack to the tune irresistibly suggested by the words,
and others joining in the chorus, till the next boy
created a diversion by starting the rival air of&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Home for the holidays here we be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Out of the clutches of L.L.D."</span><br />
</p>

<p>"'Tisn't home for the holidays," objected the
smallest girl but one. "Miss Campbell's never going
to school no more. Her's coming home for all-a-ways."</p>

<p>But in defiance of her remonstrance, the stirring
strains continued, till suddenly through the clamour
a tiny shrill voice made itself heard.</p>

<p>"Let Towzer sing, let Towzer sing," it pleaded.
"Towzer wants to sing all be-lone."</p>

<p>There was a rush in the three-year-old baby's
direction.</p>

<p>"Sing, of course she shall, the darling!" cried
Maggie, the "Jack-in-the-middle" of the five little
sisters, and the first to reach the small aspirant to
vocal honours. "She shall stand on the table," she
continued, struggling breathlessly with "Towzer," as
she tried to lift her in her arms, "and&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Out of the way, Maggie. Out of the way, Flop!"
shouted Jack, charging down ruthlessly on to the
little girls, sending Maggie to the right-about and
Flop to the left. "You are not to try to lift Towzer,
Maggie; mother has said so, ever so many times.
You'll be dropping her and smashing her to pieces
some day, the way you smashed Lady Rosalinda&mdash;you're
far too little. There now, Towzer, my pet,"
as he safely established her on the sturdy wooden
table; "sing, and we'll all clap."</p>

<p>Maggie retreated resentfully, muttering as she did
so, "I'm not little&mdash;I'm seven; and Towzer isn't
made of wax."</p>

<p>"Silence," shouted Jack, and the baby began her
song.</p>

<p>"Miss Tammel are coming out of L. D.," she
began. Shouts of laughter.</p>

<p>"Go on, darling; that's beautiful. Clap, clap,
can't you! She thinks we're laughing at her," said
Jack, the latter part of his speech an "aside" to the
audience.</p>

<p>But it was too late; Towzer's feelings were deeply
wounded.</p>

<p>"Towzer won't sing no more, naughty Jack, and
naughty Patty, and Edith, and naughty all boys and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
girls to laugh at Towzer," she cried, her very blue eyes
filling with tears. She was such a pretty little girl,
"fair, fair, with" not "golden," I should rather say,
"silvern hair," so very pale were the soft silky locks
that clustered round her little head. How she ever
came to be called "Towzer," her real name being
Angela, would have puzzled any one unused to the
extraordinary things invented by children's brains,
and the queer grotesque charm which the "rule of
contrary," especially as applied to nicknames, seems
to possess for them.</p>

<p>Towzer's tears flowed piteously; everybody at
once was trying to console her, and poor Towzer was
all but suffocated among them, when there came a
sudden interruption&mdash;a maid servant appeared at
the door.</p>

<p>"Master Jack and Master Max," she said as
soon as she could make herself heard, "your mamma
wished me to say as she hoped you were remembering
about finishing your lessons early, for Miss
Campbell's train is due at Stapleham at five, and
your papa's ordered the carriage at four, and will
be annoyed if you're not ready. And Miss Patty, I
was to say," she was continuing, when suddenly she
caught sight of "the baby" still on the table, in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
sad state of crush and discomposure, as, Jack and
Max having already rushed off, all the remaining
children were fighting for her possession. "Now
that is too bad, I do declare! What are you all
pulling and dragging at the dear child for? Making
her cry, too. Miss Maggie, you've been teasing
her, I'm certain&mdash;you're always in mischief. I'm
sure I don't know whatever nurse will say&mdash;Miss
Hangela's frock just clean on! I'm sure I hope Miss
Campbell will keep you in better order, I do; for
since your mamma's been ill, it's just dreadful the
way you go on."</p>

<p>"I didn't make her cry," "And I'm sure I didn't,"
cried Patty and Edith at once.</p>

<p>"Then it's Miss Maggie, as usual; you come too,
Miss Florence," said Dawson, as she walked off with
the rescued Towzer in her arms and Flop at her
heels, taking no notice of Maggie's indignant exclamation&mdash;"You're
a nasty, horrid, cross thing,
Dawson! and I only hope Miss Campbell will set
you down when she comes."</p>

<p>Great things were evidently expected of "Miss
Campbell," and by no one in the house was her return
looked for more eagerly than by her invalid mother,
who had of late found the care of her many boys and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
girls, weigh heavily on her. For this reason Eleanor,
the eldest daughter of the family, a girl of seventeen,
had been recalled from a school in Paris sooner than
would otherwise have been the case, and it was her
expected arrival this very evening that had caused
all the playroom commotion. It was a year, fully a
year, since she had been at home, and it was no wonder
that all her brothers and sisters rejoiced at her
return, for she was kind and unselfish, bright and
merry, and the old Manor House without her had
lost half its sunshine.</p>

<p>Five o'clock&mdash;all the children are already at
the windows, some at the door, though "she cannot
be here till six or half-past," says mamma; and
nurse valiantly refuses to put on Towzer's second
clean frock for another hour at least.</p>

<p>Six o'clock at last&mdash;five minutes, ten minutes, a
quarter past&mdash;oh, how slowly the time goes! At last
wheels, unmistakable wheels up the drive! Jack's
head poked ever so far out of the carriage window
on one side, and Max's on the other. A general
shriek, "They've come! they've come!" and in
another minute Eleanor is in her mother's arms, to
be released from them only to be hugged and re-hugged
and hugged again; while from every direction<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
comes the cry, "Miss Campbell has come, dear
Miss Campbell." "Miss Tammel are tum, dear Miss
Tammel."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At last they are all in bed&mdash;Jack, Max, Harry,
Chris, Patty, Edith, Maggie, Flop, and Towzer; and
Miss Campbell is free to sit quietly beside her
mother's sofa, with her soft thin hands in hers.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear Eleanor, how nice it is to have you
home again!"</p>

<p>"Oh, dear mamma, how nice it is to be at home
again!"</p>

<p>Then they talked together of many things&mdash;of
Eleanor's school-life and friends, of all that had
happened at home while she was away, of all the
girl hoped to do to help her mother.</p>

<p>"I shall be so thankful if you do not find the
children too much for you," said Mrs. Campbell.
"You see, Miss Fanshawe is excellent as a daily
governess, but she could not possibly stay here
altogether, on account of her invalid father; if only
it is not putting too much on you, my darling," she
added anxiously.</p>

<p>Eleanor stooped over and kissed her mother.</p>

<p>"Don't fear, dear; I may make mistakes, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
shall learn. They are dear children; how funny it
is how my old name for myself has clung to me! I
could fancy myself a baby again when I heard that
tiny Towzer calling me 'Miss Tammel.'"</p>

<p>"You will never get them to call you anything
else," said her mother. "It must sound rather odd
to strangers."</p>

<p>"And at school I was always Eleanor! But how
glad I am to be 'Miss Tammel' again. I have
brought some small presents for the children," she
went on; "books for Patty and Edith, and dolls for
the three little ones and a few bon-bons&mdash;not many,
but coming from Paris I thought they would expect
some. There are two little boxes exactly alike for
Flop and Towzer, and a rather larger one for Maggie.
So there will be no excuse for squabbling."</p>

<p>"No; that will be very nice. Poor Maggie," said
Mrs. Campbell; "I fear you will find her the most
troublesome. She is an 'odd' one; perhaps that has
to do with it, but somehow she seems always getting
into scrapes, and I fancy the others are a little sharp
on her. She has a queer temper, but she is a very
clever child."</p>

<p>"She is honest and truthful, however, is she not?"
said Eleanor. "I can stand anything if a child is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that; but deceitfulness&mdash;&mdash;" Her fair young brow
contracted, and a slightly hard expression came over
her face.</p>

<p>"I hope so," said her mother; "I have no reason
to think otherwise. But she has an extraordinary
vivid imagination, and she is curiously impressionable&mdash;the
sort of child that might be worked upon to
imagine what was not true."</p>

<p>"Still truth is truth. There can be no excuse for
a falsehood," said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Mother is too indulgent and gentle in some ways,"
she thought. "I must look after Maggie, and be firm
with her."</p>

<p>"But gentleness encourages truth, where severity
might crush it," said her mother softly, as if she had
heard Eleanor's unspoken words.</p>

<p>Miss Campbell made no reply, but she pressed her
mother's hand.</p>

<p>"And the day after to-morrow, mother dear, you
will be leaving us!" she said regretfully.</p>

<p>"Yes, but only for a month; and now that you
are here, your father and I can leave with such
lightened hearts. I feel sure that the change to St.
Abbots will do me good now," replied Mrs. Campbell
cheerfully.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">To-morrow</span>&mdash;the first part of it at least&mdash;found the
excitement scarcely less great than on the day of
Miss Campbell's arrival. For there were the presents
to distribute! A <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'delighful'">delightful</ins> business to all
concerned, as Eleanor had invariably succeeded in
choosing "just what I wanted more than anything,"
and the hugs she had again to submit to were really
alarming, both as to quantity and quality. And
among all the children none hugged her more than
Maggie.</div>

<p>"It's like Santa Claus morning&mdash;goodies too," she
exclaimed, dancing about in delight.</p>

<p>"Don't talk nonsense, you silly child," said Patty,
who was of a prosaic and literal turn of mind. "You
wouldn't believe, Miss Campbell," she went on, turning
to her elder sister, "would you, that Maggie last
Christmas went and told Flop that Santa Claus was
a real old man, and that he really came down the
chimney, and poor Flop wakened in the night, quite
frightened&mdash;screaming&mdash;and so mamma said Maggie
was never to speak about Santa Claus again, and
you <i>are</i> doing so, Maggie," she wound up with,
virtuously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"But it's so pretty about Santa Claus, and so
funny, isn't it, Miss Campbell?" said Maggie, peering
up into Eleanor's face with her bright, restless,
gray-green eyes.</p>

<p>"Nothing can be funny or pretty that mamma tells
you not to talk about, Maggie," said Miss Campbell.</p>

<p>"Oh no; I know that, and I didn't mean to speak
of it again. But except for that&mdash;if Flop hadn't got
frightened, it would be nice, wouldn't it? I have such
a lot of fairies all my own, and I wanted Flop to
have some, and she wouldn't."</p>

<p>"She was very wise; and I think, Maggie, you
might find some better things to amuse yourself with
than such fancies," said Eleanor rather severely.</p>

<p>Maggie's face fell.</p>

<p>"I'm always naughty," she whispered to herself.
"Even Miss Campbell thinks me so already, and I'm
sure fairies teach me to be good."</p>

<p>In her vague childish way she had been looking
forward to full sympathy from her eldest sister, and
her hard tone disconcerted her.</p>

<p>"Now run off, dears, quickly," said Eleanor;
"you've got your goodies safe."</p>

<p>Off they trotted, Towzer's little fat hands clasping
tight her treasures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dollies and doodies; Towzer and Flop dot just
the same," she said with delight to nurse when they
reached their own domain.</p>

<p>"And don't you think, dearie, you'd better let
nurse keep the goodies for you? See here, dears,"
said nurse to the two little girls, "we'll put both
boxes up on the high chest of drawers, where they'll
be quite safe, and you shall have some every day.
Shall we finish Miss Flop's first and then Miss
Baby's? It'll keep them fresher, not to have one
box opened till the other's done. Miss Maggie, I
suppose you'll keep your own?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie; and so it was arranged.</p>

<p>"I'll keep mine till my birthday, and then I'll
have a fairy feast, and invite Flop and Towzer," was
Maggie's secret determination, which, however, she
communicated to no one. And though she spent a
great part of her playtime unobserved in arranging
and rearranging the pretty bon-bons, not one found
its way to her mouth. Her birthday was to be in a
fortnight.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. and Mrs. Campbell left home,
and Eleanor's reign began; auspiciously enough to
all appearance.</p>

<p>"You'll be gentle with them all, dear, especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Maggie; they have not been under regular discipline
for some time, you know?" said Mrs. Campbell as she
kissed Eleanor.</p>

<p>"Of course, mamma dear; can't you trust me?"
was the reply, with the slightest touch of reproach;
and to herself the girl whispered, "Real kindness
and gentleness are not incompatible with firmness,
however."</p>

<p>On the fourth day the calm was interrupted.
Eleanor had just returned from a drive to Stapleham,
to fetch the afternoon letters, when she was seized
upon by Patty and Edith in hot indignation.</p>

<p>"Miss Campbell! Miss Campbell!" they cried.
"What do you think that naughty, greedy, mean
Maggie has done? She's stolen poor Towzer's goodies&mdash;all
of them&mdash;at least, half&mdash;the box was half full,
nurse says, and though nurse all but saw her, she will
say she didn't take them, and there was no one else
in the night nursery this afternoon. Maggie was left
in alone for half an hour, because she had a little
cold, and when nurse and the little ones came in
Towzer's box was gone."</p>

<p>Eleanor leant on the hall table for a moment. A
sick faint feeling went through her. Maggie, her
own sister, to be capable of such a thing! To her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
rigorous inexperience it seemed terrible. The idea
that taking what was not one's own and then denying
it was hardly, at seven years old, to be described
by the terms such actions on the part of an older
person would deserve, would have seemed to her
weak tampering with evil.</p>

<p>"Oh, Patty," she exclaimed, "are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Come up and see for yourself. Nurse will tell
you," said the twins, too eagerly indignant to notice
or pity their sister's distress; and Eleanor followed
their advice.</p>

<p>The charge seemed sadly well founded. Nurse
described the position of the boxes.</p>

<p>"Up on the high chest of drawers, where none of
the littler ones than Miss Maggie could climb," she
said. Flop's was empty, Towzer's still half full, when
they went out that afternoon, and nurse returning
unexpectedly, had caught sight of Maggie running
out of the night nursery&mdash;"where she had no business
to be. I had told her to stay in the other room by
the fire, and there's nothing of hers in there; for you
know, miss, she sleeps in Miss Patty's room."</p>

<p>"And what reason did she give for being there?"</p>

<p>"She got very red, miss, and at first wouldn't say
anything; but I saw she had been clambering up&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
chair was dragged out of its place&mdash;and so then she
said it was to stretch out of the window to gather
some of the ivy leaves to ornament her goodies. And
I was that silly, I believed her," said nurse, with
considerable self-disgust.</p>

<p>"You didn't look at the bon-bons then?"</p>

<p>"Never thought of them, miss, till we came in, and
the little ones asked for some, and I reached up and
found only the one box, and that empty."</p>

<p>"And you've looked all about? You're sure it
hasn't fallen down?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! Of course I looked everywhere.
Besides, I saw Miss Maggie after something in there,"
said nurse conclusively, "and my parasol that always
lies on the drawers was on the floor when I came in."</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Eleanor, "do you hear that? You
must have climbed up to the drawers."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie; "I did."</p>

<p>Eleanor breathed more freely.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>Maggie hesitated.</p>

<p>"I wanted the parasol to hook the leaves," she
said; "I saw it when I stood on the chair."</p>

<p>"Patty," said Eleanor, "go and see if there are
any leaves on Maggie's goodies."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 355px;">
<img src="images/i158.png" width="355" height="600" alt="THE MISSING BON-BONS" title="THE MISSING BON-BONS" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Patty returned. No, there were none.</p>

<p>"Well, Maggie?" said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"I know there aren't. I didn't get them. Nurse
scolded me, and I didn't like to go back to get them."</p>

<p>"Was she near the window when you saw her,
nurse?"</p>

<p>"No, miss; she was nearer to the drawers, and so
was the chair."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, "I was getting the parasol."</p>

<p>Eleanor said no more, but, rather to nurse's
annoyance, went herself to the night nursery and
thoroughly examined it. There was no trace of the
lost bon-bons.</p>

<p>"And supposing she has eaten the bon-bons, where
is the box?" she said.</p>

<p>"She may have thrown it in the fire; very likely
she didn't mean to keep the box. She may have
slipped it into her pocket in a fright," said nurse. But
no trace of it was now to be seen in Maggie's pocket.</p>

<p>"Maggie," said Eleanor, "I cannot send you to your
room on account of your cold. But no one is to speak
to you till you confess all. I shall ask you again at
bedtime, and I trust you will then speak the truth.
Now Patty, and Edith, and Flop, remember Maggie's
not to be spoken to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nasty greedy thing; and not one of her own
goodies eaten," muttered Patty. "I'm sure no one will
want to speak to her."</p>

<p>"Hush, Patty. Don't cry, Towzer darling," said
Eleanor, for poor Towzer was sobbing bitterly, though
her grief was inconsistent in its objects.</p>

<p>"No doodies, and poor Maggie!" was her lament.</p>

<p>To divert her "Miss Tammell" carried her off to
the drawing-room. And thus Maggie was sent to
Coventry.</p>

<p>By bedtime her features were hardly to be recognised,
so blurred and swollen with crying was the
poor little face. But still there was no confession.
"I didn't touch Towzer's goodies," she persisted over
and over again. Eleanor's heart ached, but still duty
must be done.</p>

<p>"How can she persist so?" she said, turning to
nurse.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed, Miss Maggie, how can you?" said
nurse. "It would almost make one believe her if
there was a chance of it, but I've had every bit of
furniture out of the room, or turned about just to
make sure. Miss Maggie's a queer child, once she
takes a thing into her head; but she's not exactly
obstinate either."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>So Maggie, "unshriven and unforgiven," was
put to bed in her misery, with no kind kiss or loving
"good-night." "If she would but own to it,
dreadful though it is," sighed Eleanor. But two
days&mdash;two days, and, worse still, two nights&mdash;went
by, and still the child held out. Eleanor herself began
to feel quite ill, and Maggie grew like a little
ghost. Her character seemed to have changed
strangely&mdash;she flew into no passions, and called no
one any names; apparently she felt no resentment,
only misery. But how terribly crushing was the
Pariah-like life she led in the nursery, probably none
of those about her had the least idea of. On the
third morning there came a change.</p>

<p>"Miss Campbell! Miss Campbell!" said Patty
and Edith, slipping with bare feet and night-gowned
little figures into their sister's room&mdash;quite against
orders, but it was a great occasion&mdash;"wake up, wake
up, Maggie's confessed!"</p>

<p>And so it proved. There sat Maggie upright in
her cot, with flushed face and excited eyes.</p>

<p>"I took them, Miss Campbell. I did take Towzer's
goodies, and eatened them up."</p>

<p>Eleanor sat down on the side of the little bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maggie!" she said reproachfully. "How<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could you! But, still more, how could you deny it so
often?"</p>

<p>Maggie looked at her bewilderedly, then meeting
the stern reproach in her sister's eyes, hid her face in
the bed-clothes while she murmured something about
not having remembered before.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Eleanor, "don't make things worse
by false excuses."</p>

<p>"Make her tell all about it," whispered Patty.</p>

<p>"No," said Eleanor; "it would only tempt her to
invent palliations. It is miserable enough&mdash;I don't
want to hear any more."</p>

<p>What "palliations" were, to Patty was by no means
clear.</p>

<p>"At least," she persisted, "you might ask her what
she did with the box."</p>

<p>Maggie caught the words.</p>

<p>"I didn't touch the box," she said, "only the
goodies."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a story!" exclaimed the twins.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, children; I will not have any more
said. Don't you see what it will lead her into," said
Eleanor.</p>

<p>But some of her old spirit seemed to have returned
to Maggie. Her eyes sparkled with eagerness as she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
repeated, "I didn't touch the box; no, I never did.
Only the goodies."</p>

<p>"Maggie, you are to say no more, but listen to
me," said Eleanor. Then sending Patty and Edith
away, she spoke to the culprit as earnestly as she
knew how of the sin of which she had been guilty,
ending by making her repeat after her a few simple
words of prayer for pardon. All this Maggie received
submissively, only whispering, as if to herself, "But
I do think God might have made me remember before!"
which remark Eleanor judged it best to ignore.
Then she kissed Maggie, and the child clung to her
affectionately. But still Eleanor could not feel satisfied;
there was a dreamy vagueness about the little
girl, a want, it seemed to Eleanor, of realising her
fault to the full, which puzzled and perplexed her.
Still Maggie was restored to favour, and in a day or
two seemed much the same as usual, even flying into
a passion when, contrary to Eleanor's order, the subject
was alluded to in the nursery and curiosity expressed
as to what had become of the box. "I don't
mind you saying I took the goodies," she said. "I
did; but I never touched the box."</p>

<p>A week, ten days, went by. It was the evening
before Maggie's birthday. All the children were in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
bed, Jack and Max at their lessons in their own room,
when a tap came at the door of the library, where
Miss Campbell was sitting alone, and in answer to
her "come in," nurse entered. She looked pale and
discomposed. Eleanor could almost have fancied she
had been crying.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"This, Miss Campbell, this is the matter," said
nurse, laying a little box on the table; "and, oh!
when I think what that poor child suffered, I feel
as if I could never forgive myself."</p>

<p>"Flop's box!" said Eleanor, bewildered; "it
can't be&mdash;surely it is Towzer's&mdash;and," as she opened
it, "half full of bon-bons!"</p>

<p>"Yes, miss; just as it was left."</p>

<p>"And Maggie never touched them?"</p>

<p>"Never touched them, miss," said nurse solemnly.
Then she explained. A dressmaker from the neighbouring
town had been in the nursery the day the
bon-bons were missed, fitting nurse in the very room
where they were. And on this person's return home,
she had found the little box among the folds of the
material. "I remember tossing a lot of things up
on to the drawers to be out of the way, because Miss
Baby would climb on to my bed, where they were,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
and I thought she would crush them," said nurse;
"and Miss Weaver never thought it of any consequence,
or she would have brought it before. It's a
long walk from Stapleham, and she knew she would
be coming in a few days with my new dress, so
thought it wouldn't matter."</p>

<p>Nurse was so genuinely distressed that Eleanor
could not find it in her heart to say anything to add
to her trouble. Besides, how could she, of all others,
do so?</p>

<p>"I," she reflected, "with mamma's warning in my
ears. Ah yes, I see now what she meant by Maggie's
impressionableness, and imaginativeness, and the
tender treatment she needs."</p>

<p>The next day Eleanor herself told Maggie of the
discovery, and showed her the box. For a moment
an expression of extreme perplexity clouded the
child's face. Then like a sudden ray of sunshine,
light broke over it.</p>

<p>"I know, Miss Campbell!" she exclaimed, "I
know how it was. I thinkened and thinkened so
much about it that at last I dreamed it. But only
about the goodies, not the box. So I didn't tell
a story, did I, Miss Campbell? Dreams aren't
stories."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, darling. And will you forgive me for doubting
you?" said Eleanor.</p>

<p>"But how could you help it, Miss Campbell, dear
Miss Campbell?" cried Maggie, without a touch of
resentment.</p>

<p>So Maggie was cleared, and the new sympathy
with her, born of this grievous mistake, never failed
her on the part of her eldest sister; and Maggie's
temper and odd ways gradually softened down into
no worse things than unusual energy and very decided
talent. She became undoubtedly the "clever
woman of the family," but as her heart expanded
with her head, Eleanor had good reason to feel
happy pride in her young sister. And when the
mother came home, after a month's absence, to find
all prospering under Miss Campbell's care, and
Eleanor felt free to tell her all that happened&mdash;which
by letter, for fear of troubling her, she had
refrained from doing&mdash;she felt that her one misgiving
as to her eldest daughter's influence over
the younger ones was removed. The lesson of the
missing bon-bons would never be forgotten. Poor
Maggie's three days of suffering had not been in
vain.</p>

<h2>LOST ROLLO</h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter I</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><ins title="Transcriber's Note: original does not use small capitals here"><span class="smcap">Ever</span></ins> since Persis and I were quite little there was
one thing we longed for more than anything else. I
think most children have some great wish, or fancy,
perhaps grown-up people would call it, like that.
But with many it changes, especially of course if
they get the thing&mdash;<i>then</i> they set to work longing
and planning for something else. But Persis and I
didn't change&mdash;not even when we got it, or thought
we had got it, for good. We wished for it for so long
that it really seemed to grow with us; the older and
bigger we grew, the stronger and bigger our wish
seemed to grow. We were only seven and five&mdash;that
sounds rather awkward, but I don't see how else
to put it, for Persis is a girl, so I must put her age
first!&mdash;she was seven and I was five (that sounds
better), when we first began wishing for it. It was
a story that first put it into our heads, and after that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nearly every story we read or heard seemed to have
to do with it somehow, and to put it still more into
them. And we were&mdash;I mean to say Persis was
eleven, and I was nine when what we thought was
going to be the fulfilment of our wish came. That
was really a long time. Four years&mdash;four summers
and winters and autumns and springs&mdash;to keep on
thinking about a thing and wishing for it!</div>

<p>I have not yet said what it was we wished for so
much. It was to have a dog of our very own. Not
a stupid little dog, though even that would perhaps
have been better than nothing, but a great beautiful
<i>big</i> dog. We did change about a little, as to the exact
kind we wished for most, but that was partly
because at first we didn't understand very well about
all the sorts of big dogs there are, and whatever kind
we happened to read about or see a picture of, we
fancied would be the nicest. But in the end we
came back pretty near to what we had begun with.
We settled that we would like a collie best of all,
because they are so faithful and intelligent, and as
the dog in the story which had made us think of it
first was a sheep-dog. That was almost the same
thing, for though all sheep-dogs are not collies, all
collies <i>are</i> sheep-dogs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two years ago that it all happened. I am
eleven now, and Persis of course is thirteen, as she is
two years older. That year we didn't know where
we were to go to for the holidays. Papa is a lawyer;
I can't exactly tell you what kind of a lawyer,
but I think he is rather a grand one, for he is always
very busy, and I know he can't do half what people
want him to do, though there are many lawyers in
London who have very little indeed to do, mamma
says. I always think it is such a pity papa can't
give them some of <i>his</i> work, isn't it? But with
being so busy, of course he gets very few holidays,
and sometimes he can't tell till just the day or
so before whether he will be able to go away or
not. And mamma doesn't like to go without him,
so two or three times we children have had to
be sent away alone with our governess and Eliza
the schoolroom maid, and we don't like that
at all.</p>

<p>It was getting very near the holidays, already the
middle of July, and though we had several times
asked mamma where we were going, she had never
been able to tell us, and at last she got tired of our
asking, and said in her rather vexed voice&mdash;she has
a vexed voice, and a <i>very</i> vexed voice as well, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
when it isn't as bad as either of these we call it her
"<i>rather</i> vexed" voice.</p>

<p>"Persis and Archie, I wish you would not ask
the same thing so often. When I have anything to
tell you I promise you I will do so at once."</p>

<p>Then <i>we</i> promised we would not tease her about
it any more, though we could not help talking about
it a good deal to ourselves.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid we're going to be sent with Miss Ellis
and Eliza like last year," I said.</p>

<p>"It'll be too bad&mdash;two years running," Persis replied.
"But it wouldn't be nearly so bad if we had
a dog, would it, Archie? Miss Ellis couldn't be so
frightened then of going <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original">on</ins> nice long walks. But it's
no use thinking about it. Mamma will never let us
have one, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>For though mamma is very kind to animals&mdash;she
wouldn't hurt any creature for the world, and
she doesn't even like killing a wasp&mdash;she does not
care much about pets, particularly not in town.
She always says they are not happy except
in the country. At least she used to say
so. I think she has rather changed her opinion
now.</p>

<p>"No," I said, sighing; "I'm afraid it's best to try<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
to leave off thinking about it. We have thought
about it such a long time, Persis."</p>

<p>But I don't think our fixing not to think any
more about it really did make us leave off doing so.
The only sensible way of putting a thing out of your
head is by putting something else there instead, and
this happened to us just then, though it didn't make
us really forget about our dog for <i>good</i>, of course.</p>

<p>One morning, about a week after the day she had
told us we weren't to tease any more, mamma called
us into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"Persis and Archie," she said, "I promised I
would tell you as soon as I knew myself about going
to the country. And you have been good children
in not teasing again about it. So I am pleased to
have good news for you. We are going next week
to a lovely place where you have never been before.
It is on the borders of Wildmoor&mdash;that beautiful
great moor where I used sometimes to go when I
was little. There are lovely walks, and it is <i>quite</i>
country, so I hope you will be very happy there."</p>

<p>"And we are <i>all</i> going&mdash;you and papa too?" we
said.</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>all</i>," mamma answered, smiling. "Would
you rather have gone without us?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Of course she only said that to tease us&mdash;she
knew quite well we wouldn't. And of course we
both jumped up and hugged her and told her she was
a very naughty little mamma to speak like that.</p>

<p>"We like Miss Ellis very well, you know,
mamma," said Persis, "but still we <i>couldn't</i> like
going with her as well as with you and papa."</p>

<p>"Indeed," said mamma, "and supposing, just
<i>supposing</i> Miss Ellis couldn't come too, would it
spoil your pleasure very much?"</p>

<p>We looked rather grave at this, for we hardly
knew what to answer. It seemed unkind to say
we should <i>not</i> much mind, for Miss Ellis is really
very kind, especially when we are left alone
with her. But yet it wouldn't have been true to
say it <i>would</i> spoil our pleasure, and if you children
are <i>real</i> children who read this, or even if
you are big people who haven't forgotten about
being children, you will know how nice it is
sometimes to get quite away from lessons and
lesson-books, and as it were to forget all about them&mdash;to
be something like lambs, or squirrels, or rabbits,
in one's feelings, just thinking about nothing except
how lovely the sunshine is, and the grass, and the
trees, and being alive altogether. And I don't think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it does us any harm, for afterwards, I think it makes
us like lessons better again, when we come back to
them, partly because it's a change, and partly too
because after so much play, the least we can do is to
try to work well. But still it seemed unkind to
Miss Ellis to say we wouldn't mind.</p>

<p>At last Persis, who generally thinks of the right
thing to say, looked up brightly.</p>

<p>"If Miss Ellis herself didn't mind, and was perhaps
going to see her own friends and be very happy,
<i>then</i> we wouldn't mind, mamma."</p>

<p>Mamma smiled.</p>

<p>"That's right, Persis, and that's just how it is.
Miss Ellis is going to have a holiday, so you and
Archie may enjoy your own holiday with clear consciences."</p>

<p>We were awfully glad after that. Everything
seemed right.</p>

<p>"If <i>only</i>," I said, "we had our dog, Bruno, Persis."</p>

<p>For we had given our fancy dog a name, and spoke
him as if he really lived.</p>

<p>"Hush, Archie," said Persis, "you promised to
leave off thinking about him. It seems greedy to
want everything. Just <i>fancy</i> what we have compared
with poor children. Lots of them don't even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
have one single day in the country, Archie," which
made me feel rather ashamed of wishing for anything
more. It was good of Persis to put it that way.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> were to go to Wildmoor the very next week,
but still it seemed a long time off. If it hadn't been
for the packing, I don't know how we'd have got
over the time, for Miss Ellis's holiday began almost
immediately, and we hadn't anything to do. Only
Eliza was to go with us, as there were to be servants
left in the house we were going to, but of course we
were very glad she was coming, as we liked her to
go out walks with us; she let us do whatever we
took into our heads.</div>

<p>It was a nice day, though rather too hot to be
pleasant for travelling, when we at last started for
Wildmoor. It wasn't a very long journey, however,
only about three hours in the railway, and the nicest
part came at the end. That was a drive of nearly
six miles. Persis and I don't count driving as
travelling at all, and this drive was perfectly lovely.
Papa had ordered a sort of covered waggonette to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
meet us at the station, and as it was a very fine
evening he let us two go outside beside the coachman,
and he went inside with mamma and Eliza,
though I'm sure he'd much rather have been on the
box. For some way the road was very pretty, but
just something like other country roads. But after
going about two miles or so we got on to the moor,
and then it just was lovely. We had never seen
moorland before, and the air was so fresh and breezy,
Persis said it made her think of the sea. Indeed, I
think a great big moor, a <i>very</i> big one, is rather like
a rough sea; the ground is all ups and downs like
big waves, and when you look far on you could
almost fancy the green ridges were beginning to heave
and roll about.</p>

<p>"Won't we have lovely walks here, Archie?"
said Persis, and "I should just think we would," I
answered.</p>

<p>And after a bit it grew even prettier; the sun
began to set, and all the colours came out in the
sky, and even the ground below seemed all burning
and glowing too. I never have seen any sunsets so
beautiful as those on the moor, and of course we
remember this one the best as it was the first we
saw.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as it was fading off into gray we turned
sharply to the left, leaving the moor, and after five
minutes' driving down a lane, we drew up at the
door of the little house that was to be our home for
the next few weeks. It was a dear little house, just
exactly what we had wished for. It had a good
many creepers over the walls, roses and honeysuckle
and clematis, and the garden was beautifully neat.
And inside there was a tiny dining-room and a rather
bigger drawing-room, and upstairs three or four very
neat bedrooms, besides those for the servants. Persis
and I had two little white rooms side by side. There
were white curtains to the beds and to the windows,
and the furniture was light-coloured wood, so they
really looked white all over.</p>

<p>That first evening we thought most of the dining-room,
or rather of the tea that was spread out for us
there. For we were so very hungry, and the things to
eat were so very good, and quite a change from London.
There were such very nice home-made bread,
and tea-cakes, and honey&mdash;honey is never so good
as in moor country, you know, it has quite a different
taste.</p>

<p>And when we had eaten, if not quite as much as
we <i>could</i>, any way quite as much as was good for us,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
we went a little turn round the garden while Eliza
was getting our trunks open, and then we said good-night
to papa and mamma and went to bed as happy,
or almost as happy, as we could be. There was just
one thought in both our minds that prevented our
being <i>quite</i> happy, but we had fixed not to speak
about it.</p>

<p>The next day and the days that followed were
delightful. The weather kept fine and the walks
were endless. Papa enjoyed it as much as we
did. He took us out himself, and when it was not
to be a very, very long walk, mamma came too.
Once or twice we carried our dinner with us and
didn't come home till evening, and several times we
had tea on the moor near our house.</p>

<p>After about a week papa told us one evening that
he had to go to London the next day to stay one
night. He had ordered a carriage to come to take
him to the station early, and he said if it was fine
Persis and I and Eliza might drive with him and
walk back across the moor, if we didn't think we'd
be tired. Of course we didn't, and though we were
sorry for him to go, we liked the idea of the drive.
And as the morning did turn out fine, it all happened
as he had planned. We saw him off, and then we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
started for our walk back. We had never been at
this side of the moor since the day we arrived, and
papa told us we might vary the walk by going down
a lane that skirted it for some way.</p>

<p>"There is a farmhouse there," he said, "where I
daresay they would give you some milk if you are
thirsty."</p>

<p>We thought it a very good idea, and after going
about half a mile down the lane we came upon the
farmhouse just as he had said. A little girl was
feeding some chickens just in front, and when we
asked her if we could have a cup of milk, she said
she would run in and see. While we were waiting
we heard a voice, a laughing merry voice it sounded,
calling out in a sort of orchard close by&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down, Rollo, down&mdash;oh, you naughty old dog,"
it said.</p>

<p>Just then the little girl came out to ask Eliza if
she'd mind coming in to fetch the milk, as she couldn't
carry both the jug and the cups. Eliza went in, and
I suppose she stayed chatting to the farmer's wife,
who, she told us afterwards, was busy churning, for
she was certainly five minutes gone. While she was
away, the gate into the orchard opened and a girl&mdash;not
a little girl, but a grown-up young lady&mdash;came<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
running out, followed by a beautiful big dog. He
was really a splendid fellow, and as she ran, he ran,
half jumping against her&mdash;I think she had something
in her hand he wanted to get&mdash;and again we heard
the laughing voice call out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Down, Rollo&mdash;you naughty old fellow. You'll
knock me over if you don't take care, you great,
clumsy darling."</p>

<p>They rushed across the road&mdash;the girl and the dog&mdash;and
down a little lane just opposite. They were
gone like a flash, but we did, at least <i>I</i> did see them,
the dog especially, quite clearly. Afterwards I tried
to fancy I hadn't, but that was not true. I did see
the dog perfectly.</p>

<p>I turned to Persis.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such a beauty?" I said. But
just then Eliza came out with the milk, and we didn't
say any more about the dog. We both kept thinking
about it all the way home, I know, but somehow
we didn't care to talk about it before Eliza. The
wish for a dog of our own had become such a very
deep-down thought in our hearts that we could not
talk about it easily or lightly&mdash;not even to each
other always.</p>

<p>Papa came back from London the next day, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
mamma was disappointed to hear that he was obliged
to return there again the end of the week, this time to
stay two nights. We did not drive with him again
to the station because it was a wet day, otherwise
we should have wished it doubly, in the chance of
having another sight of the beautiful dog.</p>

<p>It was the very day after papa had gone this
second time that a strange thing happened. Persis
and I were out in the garden rather late in the evening
before going to bed, and we had just gone a tiny
bit out into the lane to see if the sky looked red over
the moor where the sun set, when we heard a sort
of rushing, pattering sound, and looking round, what
should be coming banging along towards us, as fast as
he could, but a great big dog. He stopped when he
got up to us and began wagging his tail and rubbing
his head against us in the <i>sweetest</i> way, and then we
saw that his tongue was hanging out, and that his
coat was rough and dusty, and he breathed fast and
pantingly&mdash;he was evidently very tired, and, above
all, thirsty. I was off for a mug of water for him before
we said a word, and oh how glad he was of it!
He really said "Thank you" with his tail and his
sweet nose as plainly as if he had spoken. And he
didn't seem to think of leaving us&mdash;he was alone,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
there was no one in sight, and he seemed as if he was
sure he had found friends in us.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/i181.png" width="351" height="600" alt="LOST ROLLO" title="LOST ROLLO" />
</div>

<p>"He is very like&mdash;he is just like&mdash;-" Persis began
at last. But I interrupted her.</p>

<p>"There are lots of dogs like him," I said. "He
is lost&mdash;we must take him in for the night. Oh,
Persis, just fancy&mdash;if he is really <i>quite</i> lost, we may
have to keep him for good. Mamma might perhaps
let us. Oh, Persis!"</p>

<p>We took him in with us and called to mamma to
come out to the door to look at him. She saw what
a beauty he was at once, and stroked his head and
called him "poor doggie," for, as I said, she is
always kind to animals, though she doesn't care for
pets.</p>

<p>"We must take him in for the night any way,"
she said. "Perhaps in the morning we may find out
where he comes from."</p>

<p>There was an empty kennel in the yard, and we
found some nice clean hay in the hampers that we
had brought with groceries from London. And the
cook gave us some scraps and one or two big bones.
So "Bruno," as of course we called him, was made
very comfortable.</p>

<p>And you can fancy&mdash;no, I really&mdash;I don't think<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
you <i>can</i>&mdash;the state of excitement in which Persis
and I went to bed.</p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Chapter III</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">We</span> got up very early indeed the next morning, and
of course we both rushed straight to the yard. We
had had a dreadful feeling that perhaps somebody
would have come to claim the dog, and that we
should find him gone. But no&mdash;there he was, the
beauty, and as soon as ever he saw us, out he came
wagging his dear tail and looking as pleased as
pleased.</div>

<p>"Do you see how he knows us already, Archie?"
said Persis. "Isn't he <i>too</i> sweet? Couldn't you
really think the fairies had sent him to be our very
own?"</p>

<p>We could scarcely eat any breakfast, and the
moment it was over we dragged mamma out to look
at him. She was as nearly much taken with him
as we were, we could see, only she said one thing
which I wished she hadn't.</p>

<p>"How unhappy his owners must be at having
lost him!" it was.</p>

<p>And then she began talking about what could be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
done to find them. Persis and I didn't say anything.
We wouldn't speak even to each other about what
we both knew deep down in our hearts&mdash;we wouldn't
even think of it.</p>

<p>Papa was not to be back till the next day.
Nothing could be done till he came, any way, so all
that day Persis and I had the full happiness of Bruno.
He was so good and obedient and seemed so perfectly
at home with us, that we even ventured to
take him out a walk, though not of course a very
long one. He gambolled over the moor with us,
seemingly as happy as could be, and the very
moment we called him back he came. It was
wonderful how he seemed to know his name,
especially when we called it out rather long, making
the last "o" sound a good deal&mdash;"Bru<i>no</i>&mdash;<i>o</i>,"
like that, you know. Oh, he was so delightful!
All our fancies about having a dog seemed nothing
compared to the reality.</p>

<p>The next day papa came back. He was almost
as pleased with Bruno as we were.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, after looking him well over, "he
is a beauty and no mistake. A collie of the very
best kind. But some one or other must be in trouble
about him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's just what I have been saying," mamma
put in. "If this weren't such an out-of-the-way
place, no doubt we should have seen advertisements
about him."</p>

<p>"I'll look in the local papers," said papa.</p>

<p>And that evening when we were at tea, he came
in with a little thin-looking newspaper in his hand,
which he seemed to be searching all through for
something. Persis and I shivered, but we didn't dare
to say much.</p>

<p>"Have you been at Local, papa?" I asked. "Is
it far from here?"</p>

<p>"Been at where?" papa said. "What in the
world is the child talking about?"</p>

<p>Papa has <i>rather</i> a sharp way sometimes, but
he doesn't mean it, so we don't mind.</p>

<p>"At Local," I said again, "the place where you
said there was a newspaper. Is it anywhere near
the station?" (I <i>hoped</i> of course it was not, for the
nearer the station the more likely that the dog
should be advertised for in the newspaper. You
know of course what I mean by "near the station.")</p>

<p>To my surprise papa burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You little goose," he said, holding out the paper.
"There, look for yourself;" and I saw that the name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the paper was <i>The Wildmoor Gazette</i>. I was quite
puzzled, and I suppose my face showed it.</p>

<p>"Local," said papa, "only means connected with
the place&mdash;with any place. I just meant that I
would get the newspaper of this place to see if any
such dog as Bruno was advertised for. But I don't
see anything of the kind. I think I must put in an
advertisement of having found him."</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, you surely won't!" Persis burst out.</p>

<p>Papa turned upon her with a sort of sharpness we
did mind this time, for we saw he was quite in earnest.</p>

<p>"My dear child," he said, "what are you thinking
of? It would not be honest not to try to restore the
dog to those he belongs to. I have already told all
the neighbours about him."</p>

<p>Persis said no more, but she grew very red
indeed. I think I did too, but I'm not quite sure,
and I couldn't ask Persis afterwards, for we had
fixed in our minds we wouldn't speak of that thing.
I turned my face away, however, for fear of papa
seeing it. He would have thought there was something
very queer the matter if he had seen we
were both so red.</p>

<p>That afternoon he went out without saying where
he was going, but we both felt quite sure he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
gone about putting that horrid advertisement in the
paper. And even without that, we knew that if he
went telling about Bruno to everybody he'd be <i>sure</i>
to be claimed. The country's not like town, you see.
Everybody knows everybody else's affairs in the
country.</p>

<p>We took Bruno out, feeling that we only loved
him the more for not knowing how soon he might be
taken from us. We both hugged him and cried over
him that afternoon, and the dear fellow seemed to
understand. He looked up in our faces with such
<i>very</i> "doggy" eyes.</p>

<p>And after that, there never, for some days, came a
knock at the door, or the sound of a strange voice in
the kitchen, without our trembling. And we never
came in from a walk with Bruno without getting
cold all over at the thought that perhaps some one
might be waiting for him.</p>

<p>But nothing of the sort did happen. And time
went on, till it grew to be nearly three weeks that
our dear dog had been with us.</p>

<p>One evening papa came to us in the yard when
we were saying good-night to Bruno.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're getting to think him quite your
own," he said. "It certainly does not seem as if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
were going to be owned. But what will mamma say
to taking him home with us&mdash;eh, little people?"</p>

<p>"I don't think she'll mind," said Persis. "She
loves him too&mdash;awfully. And Archie and I are full
of plans about how to manage him in London."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed," said papa. "Well, one of the first
things to be done, it seems to me," he went on, "is
to get him a collar," and he drew a yard measure out
of his pocket and measured Bruno's neck. "I am
going up to town to-morrow for two nights," he then
told us. "You two can come to meet me at the
station when I come back, with Eliza, of course, and
this fellow, and you shall see what I can get in the
way of a collar. I'll tell mamma the train, and you
can all drive home with me."</p>

<p>We thanked papa&mdash;it was very kind of him, and
we said we'd like to go to meet him very much.
But things seldom turn out as one expects. The
day papa was to come mamma had to go to the little
town near the station herself&mdash;something about a
washerwoman it was&mdash;so she ordered a carriage, and
we drove over with her. We were all at the station
together to meet papa, and when he came he had
brought the loveliest collar for Bruno&mdash;with his name
on, and ours, and our address in London!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>We</i> won't risk losing him," papa said.</p>

<p>Then he asked us if we wouldn't rather walk
home, and we said we should, as we had driven there,
and mamma didn't mind going back alone. So we
set off, us two and papa. And we were so happy
and so sure now of Bruno being ours, that we didn't
notice that papa took the way down the lane that we
had been once before.</p>

<p>We never noticed it, till we were close to the gate
of the farm&mdash;the very farm where we had got milk&mdash;the
very gate where&mdash;-</p>

<p>And, just as we got up to it, it opened, and a girl,
a lady, <i>the very one</i>, came out, not running and jumping,
but walking quite quietly. But when she caught
sight of us, of Bruno, and when he caught sight of
her! Oh! He rushed at her, and she threw her
arms round him.</p>

<p>"Oh, my Rollo, my own dear naughty Rollo," she
called out, and I believe she was crying. "Have you
come back to me at last? Where <i>have</i> you been?"</p>

<p>And Bruno&mdash;<i>our</i> Bruno&mdash;went on wagging his
tail and rubbing his nose on her, and pawing at her,
just as he had done to us, only <i>more!</i></p>

<p>Persis and I stood stock-still, feeling as if we
<i>couldn't</i> bear it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>


<h3><br /><span class="smcap">Chapter IV</span></h3>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Papa</span> was the first to speak. The young lady went
on hugging at Bruno, and taking no notice of any of
us. Papa looked very grave. I think he thought it
rather rude of her, even if she was so pleased to find
her dog again, for she might have seen how well he
had been taken care of, and what a beautiful new
collar he had. Papa waited a minute or two, and
then he said, rather grandly, you know&mdash;</div>

<p>"Excuse me, madam, for interrupting you. I
should be glad of some explanation about the dog.
Is he your dog?"</p>

<p>"<i>My</i> dog," said the girl, half sitting up and shaking
her hair back. It had got messy with all her hugging
at Bruno. "I should rather think so. I have nothing
to explain. What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said papa. "I have had
the dog nearly a month, and during that time I have
advertised him regularly. I have sent all about the
neighbourhood to ask if any one had lost a dog, and
altogether I have had a good deal of trouble and
expense."</p>

<p>The girl got rather red.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I see," she said, "I didn't think of that. I was
only so glad to find my dear dog. I'm very much
obliged to you, I'm sure. I can tell you why your
advertisements were never answered. We've been
away for nearly a month, and the people here whom
we lodge with have been very stupid about it. They
missed Rollo as soon as we left, and took for granted
we'd taken him with us after all. And we never
knew till we came back two days ago that he was
lost. He was lonely, you see, when he found I
had gone, and I suppose he set out to look for
me."</p>

<p>"Yes," said papa. "Then I suppose there is
nothing more to be said. My children must bear
the disappointment; they had naturally come to
look upon him as their own."</p>

<p>Persis and I had turned away, so she couldn't
see we were crying. We didn't want her to see; we
didn't like her.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I can't offer to pay you anything of what he's
cost you, I suppose?" she said, getting redder still.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Good-morning," and papa lifted
his hat. And we all went off.</p>

<p>"My poor Persis and Archie," said papa very
kindly. And when he said that, we felt as if we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
couldn't keep it in any longer. We both burst out
crying&mdash;loud.</p>

<p>Just then we heard steps behind us. It was the
girl running with the lovely new collar in her
hand.</p>

<p>"This at least is yours," she said, holding it out to
papa. He smiled a little.</p>

<p>"You will please us by keeping it," he said. "It
fits him; you can easily have the engraving altered."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said; "thank you very much.
I am very sorry indeed for the children," she went
on, for she couldn't have helped seeing how we were
crying; and a nice look came into her eyes, which
made us like her better. She was very pretty. I
forget if I said so. "Shall I&mdash;shall I bring Rollo
some day to see you?"</p>

<p>But we shook our heads.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," Persis managed to get out.</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, "I'm sorry; but I understand."</p>

<p>And then we liked her <i>quite</i>.</p>

<p>We trotted on beside papa, none of us speaking.
At last Persis touched me.</p>

<p>"Archie," she said, "I think it's for a punishment.
May I tell?"</p>

<p>I just nodded my head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Persis went close up to papa and put her
hand through his arm.</p>

<p>"Papa," she said, "we've something to tell you.
We're not crying <i>only</i> for Bruno, we're unhappy
because&mdash;because we've not been good."</p>

<p>"We've not been <i>honest</i>," I said. That word
"honest" had been sticking in my throat ever since
the day papa had said it when he was speaking
about it being right to advertise the dog. And now,
when <i>I</i> said it, I felt as if I was going to choke. It
felt so awful, you don't know.</p>

<p>Papa looked very grave, but he held out his other
hand to me, and I was glad of that.</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it," he said; and then we told
him everything&mdash;all about how in our real hearts
we had known, or <i>almost</i> known, where Bruno came
from, but how we had tried to pretend to ourselves&mdash;separately,
I mean; Persis to herself and me to
myself&mdash;that we didn't know, so that we wouldn't
even say it to each other, and how it did seem now
as if this had come for a punishment.</p>

<p>Papa was very kind, so kind that we went on to
tell him how great the temptation had been, how
<i>dreadfully</i> we had longed for a dog, and how it had
seemed that our only chance of ever having one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
would be one coming of itself, like Bruno had
done.</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell mamma or me how very,
very much you wished for one?" asked papa. "It
would have been better than bottling it up so between
yourselves. You have made yourselves think
you wished for one even more than you really
did."</p>

<p>But we couldn't quite agree with that.</p>

<p>"We did speak of it sometimes," we said, "but
we knew mamma didn't want to have a dog&mdash;not in
London. And&mdash;&mdash;" but there we stopped. We really
didn't quite know why we hadn't said more about it.
I think children often keep their fancies to themselves
without quite knowing why. But we didn't
think it had been a fancy only, after all. "We <i>couldn't</i>
have loved him more," we said. "The real of it
turned out quite as nice as the fancy."</p>

<p>Then papa spoke to us very seriously. I daresay
you can tell of yourselves&mdash;all of you who have
nice fathers and mothers&mdash;the sort of way he spoke.
About being quite, <i>quite</i> true and honest even in
thinkings, and about how dangerous it is to try to
deceive <i>ourselves</i>, for that the self we try to deceive
is the best part of us, the voice of God in our hearts,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and it can never <i>really</i> be deceived, only, if we don't
listen to it, after a while we can't hear it any more.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Persis, "I did know I was shamming
to my good self all the time."</p>

<p>Then she cried a little more&mdash;and I did too. And
papa kissed us, and we went on home, rather sadly
of course, but still feeling, in a good way, glad too.
And papa told it all to mamma, so that she kissed
us <i>very</i> nicely when she said good-night, and called
us her poor darlings.</p>

<p>You may think that is the end. But it isn't. The
end is lovely.</p>

<p>About a week after that day, one afternoon we
heard that a lady and gentleman with a big dog had
come to call on papa and mamma. We were afraid
it was Bruno, and the people belonging to him, and
as we didn't want to see him again, we were just
going to run out and hide in the garden for fear we
should be sent for, when papa himself came calling
for us.</p>

<p>"Persis. Archie." And we dared not run away.</p>

<p>"Papa," we said, "we don't want to come if it is
Bruno."</p>

<p>"It is Bruno," he said; "but, all the same, you
must come. You must trust me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>We had to go into the drawing-room. There was
the girl talking quite nicely to mamma, and a gentleman
with her, who we saw was her brother, and&mdash;there
was Bruno! We tried not to look at
him, while we shook hands. How silly we
were!</p>

<p>"Children," said papa, "this young lady has come
to say something which will please you very much.
She finds, quite unexpectedly, that she cannot keep
her dog, as she and Mr. Riverton"&mdash;papa made a
little bow to the brother&mdash;"are going abroad. Miss
Riverton wants a good home for her dog. Do you
think we could promise him one?"</p>

<p>We could scarcely speak. It seemed too good to
be true.</p>

<p>"Would he be ours for always?" I asked, and the
young lady said, "Yes, of course. I wouldn't want
to give you the pain of parting with him <i>twice</i>, you
poor children."</p>

<p>"And mamma says we may?" we asked. And
mamma nodded. Then Persis had a nice thought.</p>

<p>"Aren't you very sorry?" she asked the girl.
But <i>she</i> only smiled. "No, I can't say I am," she
said, "because I know he'll be very happy with you.
And though I love him very much, I love my brother<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
better, and I'm <i>very</i> glad to go with him instead of
being left behind, even with Rollo."</p>

<p>We <i>quite</i> liked her then. Her face was so nice.
And she kissed us when she went away. Persis
liked it, and I didn't mind.</p>

<p>Our Bruno has been with us ever since, and we
love him more and more. He is quite happy, even
in London, for he has a nice home in the stables, and
we take him a walk every day, and he comes very
often into the house. And in the country, where we
now go for much longer every year, he is always
with us.</p>

<p>The girl writes to us sometimes, and we answer,
and tell her about Bruno. She is coming to see him
next year, when they come back to England. She
calls him "Rollo," but we like "Bruno" best, and <i>he</i>
doesn't mind, the dear old fellow.</p>

<h2>THE BLUE DWARFS:</h2>

<h3>AN ADVENTURE IN TH&Uuml;RINGEN</h3>

<div class='poem'>
"And then on the top of the Caldon Low<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">There was no one left but me."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='sig2'>
<span class="smcap">Mary Howitt</span>.<br />
</div>


<div class='unindent'>"I <span class="smcap">liked</span> the blue dwarfs the best&mdash;far, far the best
of anything," said Olive.</div>

<p>"'The blue dwarfs!'" repeated Rex. "What <i>do</i>
you mean? Why can't you say what you mean
plainly? Girls have such a stupid way of talking!"</p>

<p>"What can be plainer than <i>the blue dwarfs?</i>" said
Olive rather snappishly, though, it must be allowed,
with some reason. "We were talking about the things
we liked best at the china place. <i>You</i> said the stags'
heads and the inkstands, and <i>I</i> say the blue dwarfs."</p>

<p>"But I didn't see any dwarfs," persisted Rex.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help it if you didn't. You had
just as much chance of seeing them as I had. They
were in a corner by themselves&mdash;little figures about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
two inches high, all with blue coats on. There were
about twelve of them, all different, but all little
dwarfs or gnomes. One was sitting on a barrel, one
was turning head-over-heels, one was cuddling his
knees&mdash;all funny ways like that. Oh, they were
lovely!"</p>

<p>"I wish I had seen them better," said Rex regretfully.
"I do remember seeing a tray full of little
blue-looking dolls, but I didn't notice what they
were."</p>

<p>Olive did not at once answer. Her eyes were
fixed on something she saw passing before the window.
It was a very, very little man. He was not
exactly hump-backed, but his figure was somewhat
deformed, and he was so small that but for the sight
of his rather wizened old face one could hardly have
believed he was a full-grown man. His eyes were
bright and beady-looking, like those of a good-natured
little weasel, if there be such a thing, and
his face lighted up with a smile as he caught sight of
the two, to him, strange-looking children at the open
window of the little village inn.</p>

<p>"Guten Tag," he said, nodding to them; and
"Guten Tag," replied the children, as they had learnt
to do by this time to everybody they met. For in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
these remote villages it would be thought the greatest
breach of courtesy to pass any one without this
friendly greeting.</p>

<p>Rex drew a long breath when the dwarf had
passed.</p>

<p>"Olive&mdash;&mdash;" he began, but Olive interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Rex," she said eagerly, "that's <i>exactly</i> like them&mdash;like
the blue dwarfs, I mean. Only, of course,
their faces were prettier&mdash;nice little china faces,
rather crumply looking, but quite nice; and then
their coats were such a pretty nice blue. I think,"
she went on consideringly&mdash;"I think, if I had that
little man and washed his face <i>very</i> well, and got
him a bright blue coat, he would look just like one
of the blue dwarfs grown big."</p>

<p>Rex looked at Olive with a queer expression.</p>

<p>"Olive," he said in rather an awe-struck tone;
"Olive, do you think perhaps they're <i>real?</i> Do you
think perhaps somewhere in this country&mdash;in those
queer dark woods, perhaps&mdash;that there are real blue
dwarfs, and that somebody must have seen them
and made the little china ones like them? Perhaps,"
and his voice dropped and grew still more solemn;
"<i>perhaps</i>, Olive, that little man's one of them, and they
may have to take off their blue coats when they're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
walking about. Do you know, I think it's a little,
just a very little frightening? Don't you, Olive?"</p>

<p>"No, of course I don't," said Olive, and, to do her
justice, her rather sharp answer was meant as much
to reassure her little brother as to express any feeling
of impatience. Rex was quite a little fellow, only
eight, and Olive, who was nearly twelve, remembered,
that when she was as little as that, she used
sometimes to feel frightened about things which she
now couldn't see anything the least frightening in.
And she remembered how once or twice some of her
big cousins had laughed at her, and amused themselves
by telling her all sorts of nonsense, which still
seemed terrible to her when she was alone in her
room in the dark at night. "Of course there's nothing
frightening in it," she said. "It would be rather
a funny idea, I think. Of course it can't be, you
know, Rex. There are no dwarfs, and gnomes, and
fairies now."</p>

<p>"But that little man was a dwarf," said Rex.</p>

<p>"Yes, but a dwarf needn't be a fairy sort of person,"
explained Olive. "He's just a common little man,
only he's never grown as big as other people. Perhaps
he had a bad fall when he was a baby&mdash;that
might stop his growing."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would it?" said Rex. "I didn't know that.
I hope I hadn't a bad fall when I was a baby.
Everybody says I'm very small for my age." And
Rex looked with concern at his short but sturdy legs.</p>

<p>Olive laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Oh, Rex, what a funny boy you are! No,
certainly, you are not a dwarf. You're as straight
and strong as you can be."</p>

<p>"Well, but," said Rex, returning to the first subject,
"I do think it's very queer about that little dwarf
man coming up the street just as you were telling
me about the blue dwarfs. And he <i>did</i> look at
us in a funny way, Olive, whatever you say, just
as if he had heard what we were talking
about."</p>

<p>"All the people look at us in a funny way here,"
said Olive. "We must look very queer to them.
Your sailor suit, Rex, and my 'Bolero' hat must
look to them quite as queer as the women's purple
skirts, with bright green aprons, look to us."</p>

<p>"Or the bullock-carts," said Rex. "Do you remember
how queer we thought them at first? <i>Now</i>
we've got quite used to seeing queer things, haven't
we, Olive? Oh! now do look there&mdash;at the top of the
street&mdash;there, Olive, did you <i>ever</i> see such a load as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
that woman is carrying in the basket on her back?
Why, it's as big as a house!"</p>

<p>He seemed to have forgotten about the dwarfs,
and Olive was rather glad of it. These two children
were travelling with their uncle and aunt in a rather
out-of-the-way part of Germany. Out-of-the-way,
that is to say, to most of the regular summer tourists
from other countries, who prefer going where they
are more sure of finding the comforts and luxuries
they are accustomed to at home. But it was by no
means out-of-the-way in the sense of being dull or
deserted. It is a very busy part of the world indeed.
You would be amazed if I were to tell you some of
the beautiful things that are made in these bare
homely little German cottages. For all about in the
neighbourhood there are great manufactories and
warehouses for china and glass, and many other
things; and some parts of the work are done by the
people at home in their own houses. The morning
of the day of which I am telling you had been spent
by the children and their friends in visiting a very
large china manufactory, and their heads were full of
the pretty and wonderful things they had seen.</p>

<p>And now they were waiting in the best parlour of
the village inn while their uncle arranged about a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
carriage to take them all on to the small town where
they were to stay a few days. Their aunt was tired,
and was resting a little on the sofa, and they had
planted themselves on the broad window-sill, and
were looking out with amusement at all that passed.</p>

<p>"What have you two been chattering about all
this time?" said their aunt, suddenly looking up.
"I think I must have been asleep a little, but I
have heard your voices going on like two birds
twittering."</p>

<p>"Have we disturbed you, Auntie?" asked Olive,
with concern.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not a bit; but come here and tell me
what you have been talking about."</p>

<p>Instantly Rex's mind went back to the dwarfs.</p>

<p>"Auntie," he said seriously, "perhaps you can
tell me better than Olive can. Are there really
countries of dwarfs, and are they a kind of fairies,
Auntie?"</p>

<p>Auntie looked rather puzzled.</p>

<p>"Dwarfs, Rex?" she said; "countries of dwarfs?
How do you mean?"</p>

<p>Olive hastened to explain. Auntie was very
much amused.</p>

<p>"Certainly," she said, "we have already seen so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
many strange things in our travels that it is better
not to be too sure what we may not see. But any
way, Rex, you may be quite easy in your mind, that
if ever you come across any of the dwarfs, you will
find them very good-natured and amiable, only you
must be very respectful&mdash;always say 'Sir,' or 'My
lord,' or something like that to them, and bow a
great deal. And you must never seem to think anything
they do the least odd, not even if they propose
to you to walk on your head, or to eat roast fir-cones
for dinner, for instance."</p>

<p>Auntie was quite young&mdash;not so very much older
than Olive&mdash;and very merry. Olive's rather "grown-up"
tones and manners used sometimes to tempt her
to make fun of the little girl, which, to tell the truth,
Olive did not always take quite in good part. And
it must for Olive be allowed, that Auntie did sometimes
allow her spirits and love of fun to run away
with her a little too far, just like pretty unruly
ponies, excited by the fresh air and sunshine, who
toss their heads and gallop off. It is great fun at
first and very nice to see, but one is sometimes
afraid they may do some mischief on the way&mdash;without
meaning it, of course; and, besides, it is not
always so easy to pull them up as it was to start them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as Auntie finished speaking the door opened
and their uncle came in. He was Auntie's elder
brother&mdash;a good deal older&mdash;and very kind and
sensible. At once all thoughts of the dwarfs or what
Auntie had been saying danced out of Rex's curly
head. Like a true boy he flew off to his uncle, besieging
him with questions as to what sort of a
carriage they were to go on in&mdash;<i>was</i> it an ox-cart;
oh, mightn't they <i>for once</i> go in an ox-cart? and
might he&mdash;oh, might he sit beside the driver in
front?</p>

<p>His uncle laughed and replied to his questions,
but Olive stayed beside the sofa, staring gravely at
her aunt.</p>

<p>"Auntie," she said, "you're not <i>in earnest</i>, are
you, about there being really a country of dwarfs?"</p>

<p>Olive was twelve. Perhaps you will think her
very silly to have imagined for a moment that
her aunt's joke could be anything but a joke, especially
as she had been so sensible about not letting
Rex get anything into his head which could frighten
him. But I am not sure that she was so very silly
after all. She had read in her geography about the
Lapps and Finns, the tiny little men of the north,
whom one might very well describe as dwarfs;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
there might be dwarfs in these strange Th&uuml;ringian
forests, which were little spoken of in geography
books; Auntie knew more of such things than she
did, for she had travelled in this country before.
Then with her own eyes Olive had seen a dwarf, and
though she had said to Rex that he was just an odd
dwarf by himself as it were, not one of a race, how
could she tell but what he might be one of a number
of such queer little people? And even the blue
dwarfs themselves&mdash;the little figures in the china
manufactory&mdash;rather went to prove it than not.</p>

<p>"They may have taken the idea of dwarfs from
the real ones, as Rex said," thought Olive. "Any
way I shall look well about me if we go through any
of these forests again. They must live in the forests,
for Auntie said they eat roast fir-cones for dinner."</p>

<p>All these thoughts were crowding through her
mind as she stared up into Auntie's face and asked
solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Auntie, were you in earnest?"</p>

<p>Auntie's blue eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>"In earnest, Olive?" she said. "Of course!
Why shouldn't I be in earnest? But come, quick,
we must get our things together. Your uncle must
have got a carriage."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I have. <i>Not</i> an ox-cart, Rex.
I'm sorry for your sake, but for no one else's; for I
don't think there would be much left of us by the
end of the journey if we were to be jogged along the
forest roads in an ox-cart. No! I have got quite
a respectable vehicle; but we must stop an hour or
two on the way, to rest the horses and give them a
feed, otherwise we could not get through to-night."</p>

<p>"Where shall we stop?" said Auntie, as with
the bundles of shawls and bags they followed the
children's uncle to the door.</p>

<p>"There is a little place in the forest, where they
can look after the horses," said he; "and I daresay
we can get some coffee there for ourselves, if we
want it. It is a pretty little nook. I remember
it long ago, and I shall be glad to see it again."</p>

<p>Olive had pricked up her ears. "A little place
in the forest!" she said to herself; "that may be
near where the dwarfs live: it is most likely not far
from here, because of the one we saw." She would
have liked to ask her uncle about it, but something
in the look of her aunt's eyes kept her from
doing so.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she <i>was</i> joking," thought Olive to herself.
"But perhaps she doesn't know; <i>she</i> didn't see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
the real dwarf. It would be rather nice if I did
find them, <i>then</i> Auntie couldn't laugh at me any
more."</p>

<p>They were soon comfortably settled in the carriage,
and set off. The first part of the drive was not particularly
interesting; and it was so hot, though
already afternoon, that they were all&mdash;Olive especially,
you may be sure&mdash;delighted to exchange the
open country for the pleasant shade of a grand pine
forest, through which their road now lay.</p>

<p>"Is it a very large forest, Uncle?" said Olive.</p>

<p>"Yes, very large," he replied rather sleepily, to
tell the truth; for both he and Auntie had been
nodding a little, and Rex had once or twice been
fairly asleep. But Olive's imagination was far too
hard at work to let her sleep.</p>

<p>"The largest in Europe?" she went on, without
giving much thought to poor Uncle's sleepiness.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, by far," he replied, for he had not heard
clearly what she said, and fancied it was "the largest
hereabouts."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" thought Olive, looking round her
with awe and satisfaction. "If there are dwarfs
anywhere, then it must be here."</p>

<p>And she was just beginning another. "And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
please, Uncle, is&mdash;&mdash;?" when her aunt looked up and
said lazily&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear child, do be quiet! Can't you go
to sleep yourself a little? We shall have more than
enough of the forest before we are out of it." Which
offended Olive so much that she relapsed into silence.</p>

<p>Auntie was a truer prophet than she knew; for
when they got to the little hamlet in the wood,
where they were to rest, something proved to be
wrong with one of the horse's shoes; <i>so</i> wrong, indeed,
that after a prolonged examination, at which all the
inhabitants turned out to assist, it was decided that
the horse must be re-shod before he could go any
farther; and this made it impossible for the party
who had come in the carriage to go any farther
either. For the nearest smithy was two miles off;
the horse must be led there and back by the driver,
which would take at least two, if not three, hours.
It was now past six, and they had come barely half
way. The driver shook his head, and said he would not
like to go on to the town till morning. The horse
had pricked his foot; it might cause inflammation
to drive him farther without a rest, and the carriage
was far too heavy for the other horse alone, which had
suddenly struck the children's uncle as a brilliant idea.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>"There would be no difficulty about the harnessing,
any way," he said to Auntie, laughing; "for all
the vehicles hereabouts drawn by one horse have the
animal at one side of a pole, instead of between
shafts."</p>

<p>But Auntie thought it better to give in.</p>

<p>"It really doesn't much matter," she said; "we
can stay here well enough. There are two bedrooms,
and no doubt they can give us something to eat;
beer and sausages, and brown bread any way."</p>

<p>And so it was settled, greatly to Olive's satisfaction;
it would give her capital opportunities for a
dwarf hunt! though as to this she kept her own
counsel.</p>

<p>The landlady of the little post-house where they
had stopped was accustomed to occasional visits of
this kind from benighted or distressed travellers.
She thought nothing of turning her two daughters
out of their bedroom, which, it must be owned, was
very clean, for Auntie and Olive, and a second room
on the ground-floor was prepared for Rex and his
uncle. She had coffee ready in five minutes, and
promised them a comfortable supper before bedtime.
Altogether, everything seemed very satisfactory,
and when they felt a little refreshed, Auntie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
proposed a walk&mdash;"a good long walk," she said,
"would do us good. And the landlady says we get
out of the forest up there behind the house, where
the ground rises, and that there is a lovely view. It
will be rather a climb, but it isn't more than three-quarters
of an hour from here, and we have not
walked all day."</p>

<p>Uncle thought it a good idea, and Rex was ready
to start at once; but Olive looked less pleased.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to come, Olive?" said Auntie.
"Are you tired? You didn't take a nap like the
rest of us."</p>

<p>"I am a little tired," said Olive, which was true
in one sense, though not in another, for she was quite
fit for a walk. It struck her that her excuse was
not quite an honest one, so she added, "If you don't
mind, I would rather stay about here. I don't mind
being alone, and I have my book. And I do so like
the forest."</p>

<p>"Very well," said her uncle; "only don't lose
yourself. She is perfectly safe," he added, turning
to her aunt; "there are neither wolves, nor
bears, nor robbers nowadays, in these peaceful
forests."</p>

<p>So the three set off, leaving Olive to her own devices.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
She waited till they were out of sight, then
she made her preparations.</p>

<p>"I'd better take my purse," she said to herself,
"in case I meet the dwarfs. Auntie told me to be
very polite, and perhaps they would like some of
these tiny pieces; they just look as if they were
meant for them." So she chose out a few one-pfennig
copper coins, which are much smaller than
our farthings, and one or two silver pieces, worth
about twopence-halfpenny each, still smaller. Then
she put in her pocket half a slice of the brown bread
they had had with their coffee, and arming herself,
more for <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'appearance'-sake'">appearance's-sake</ins> than anything else, with
her parasol and the book she had with her in her
travelling bag, she set off on her solitary ramble.</p>

<p>It was still hot&mdash;though the forest trees made a
pleasant shade. Olive walked some way, farther
and farther, as far as she could make out, into the
heart of the forest, but in her inexperience she took
no sort of care to notice the way she went, or to
make for herself any kind of landmarks. She just
wandered on and on, tempted first by some mysterious
little path, and then by another, her mind full of
the idea of the discoveries she was perhaps about to
make. Now and then a squirrel darted across from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
one tree to another, disappearing among the branches
almost before Olive could be sure she had seen it,
or some wild wood birds, less familiar to the little
foreigner, would startle her with a shrill, strange note.
There were here and there lovely flowers growing
among the moss, and more than once she heard the
sound of not far off trickling water. It was all
strangely beautiful, and she would greatly have
enjoyed and admired it had not her mind been
so full of the queer fascinating idea of the blue
dwarfs.</p>

<p>At last&mdash;she had wandered about for some time&mdash;Olive
began to feel tired.</p>

<p>"I may as well sit down a little," she thought;
"I have lots of time to get back. This seems the
very heart of the forest. They are just as likely to
be seen here as anywhere else."</p>

<p>So Olive ensconced herself in a comfortable corner,
her back against the root of a tree, which seemed
hollowed out on purpose to serve as an arm-chair.
She thought at first she would read a little, but the
light was already slightly waning, and the tree
shadows made it still fainter. Besides, Olive had
plenty to think of&mdash;she did not require any amusement.
Queer little noises now and then made themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
heard&mdash;once or twice it really sounded as if
small feet were pattering along, or as if shrill little
voices were laughing in the distance; and with
each sound, Olive's heart beat faster with excitement&mdash;not
with fear.</p>

<p>"If I sit very still," she thought, "who knows
what I may see? Of course, it would be much nicer
and prettier if the dwarfs were quite tiny&mdash;not like the
little man we saw in the street at that place&mdash;I forget
the name&mdash;for he was not pretty at all&mdash;but like the
blue dwarfs at the manufactory. But that, I suppose,
is impossible, for they would be really like fairies.
But they might be something between: not so big
as the little man, and yet bigger than the blue
dwarfs."</p>

<p>And then Olive grew a little confused in trying
to settle in her mind how big, or how small rather,
it was possible or impossible for a nation of dwarfs
to be. She thought it over till she hardly seemed
sure what she was trying to decide. She kept saying
to herself, "Any way, they could not but be a good
deal bigger than my thumb! What does that mean?
Perhaps it means more in German measures than in
English, perhaps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">
<img src="images/i218.png" width="356" height="600" alt="THE BLUE DWARFS" title="THE BLUE DWARFS" />
</div>

<p>But what was that that suddenly hit her on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
nose? Olive looked up, a very little inclined to be
offended; it is not a pleasant thing to be hit on the
nose; could it be Rex come behind her suddenly, and
playing her a trick? Just as she was thinking this,
a second smart tap on the nose startled her still more,
and this time there was no mistake about it; it came
from above, and it was a fir-cone! Had it come of
itself? Somehow the words, "Roast fir-cones for
dinner," kept running in her head, and she took up
the fir-cone in her fingers to examine it, but quickly
dropped it again, for it was as hot as a coal.</p>

<p>"It has a very roasty smell," thought Olive;
"where can it have come from?"</p>

<p>And hardly had she asked herself the question,
when a sudden noise all round her made her again
look up. They were sliding down the branches of
the tree in all directions. At first, to her dazzled
eyes, they seemed a whole army, but as they touched
the ground one by one, and she was able to distinguish
them better, she saw that after all there
were not so <i>very</i> many. One, two, three, she began
quickly counting to herself, not aloud, of course&mdash;that
would not have been polite&mdash;one, two, three, up
to twelve, then thirteen, fourteen, and so on up to&mdash;yes,
there were just twenty-four of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>"Two of each," said Olive to herself; "a double
set of the blue dwarfs."</p>

<p>For they were the blue dwarfs, and no mistake!
Two of each, as Olive had seen at once. And immediately
they settled themselves in twos&mdash;two
squatted on the ground embracing their knees,
two strode across a barrel which they had somehow
or other brought with them, two began turning head-over-heels,
two knelt down with their heads and
queer little grinning faces looking over their shoulders,
twos and twos of them in every funny position you
could imagine, all arranged on the mossy ground in
front of where Olive sat, and all dressed in the same
bright blue coats as the toy dwarfs at the china
manufactory.</p>

<p>Olive sat still and looked at them. Somehow she
did not feel surprised.</p>

<p>"How big are they?" she said to herself. "Bigger
than my thumb? Oh yes, a good deal. I should
think they are about as tall as my arm would be if
it was standing on the ground. I should think they
would come up above my knee. I should like to
stand up and measure, but perhaps it is better
for me not to speak to them till they speak to
me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>She had not long to wait. In another moment
two little blue figures separated themselves from the
crowd, and made their way up to her. But when
they were close to her feet they gave a sudden
jump in the air, and came down, not on their feet,
but on their heads! And then again some of her
aunt's words came back to her, "If they should ask
you to stand on your head, for instance."</p>

<p>"Dear me," thought Olive, "how did Auntie know
so much about them? But I do hope they won't ask
me to stand on <i>my</i> head."</p>

<p>Her fears were somewhat relieved when the
dwarfs gave another spring and came down this
time in a respectable manner on their feet. Then,
with a good many bows and flourishes, they began a
speech.</p>

<p>"We are afraid," said the first.</p>

<p>"That the fir-cones," said the second.</p>

<p>"Were rather underdone," finished up the first.</p>

<p>Olive really did not know what to say. She was
dreadfully afraid that it would seem so very rude of
her not even to have <i>tasted</i> the cones. But naturally
she had not had the slightest idea that they had been
intended for her to eat.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry," she said, "Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, sir! my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
lord! I beg your pardon. I don't quite know what
I should call you."</p>

<p>"With all respect," said the first.</p>

<p>"And considering the circumstances," went on the
second.</p>

<p>Then, just as Olive supposed they were going to
tell her their names, they stopped short and looked at
her.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she began again, after waiting
a minute or two to see if they had nothing else
to say; "I don't quite understand."</p>

<p>"Nor do we," they replied promptly, speaking for
the first time both together.</p>

<p>"Do you mean you don't know what <i>my</i> name is?"
said she. "It's Olive, <i>Olive!</i>" for the dwarfs stood
staring as if they had not heard her. "<span class="smcap">Olive!</span>" she
repeated for the third time.</p>

<p>"Green?" asked the first.</p>

<p>"No!" said Olive. "Of course not! <i>Green</i> is a
very common name&mdash;at least&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you called us 'blue,'" said the second; and it
really was a relief to hear him finish a sentence comfortably
by himself, only Olive felt very puzzled by
what he said.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" she said. "How could you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
tell I called you the blue dwarfs?" and then another
thought suddenly struck her. How very odd it was
that the dwarf spoke such good English! "I thought
you were German," she said.</p>

<p>"How very amusing!" said the dwarfs, this time
again speaking together.</p>

<p>Olive could not see that it was very amusing,
but she was afraid of saying so, for fear it should be
rude.</p>

<p>"And about the fir-cones," went on the first dwarf.
"It is distressing to think they were so underdone.
But we have come, all of us," waving his hand in the
direction of the others, "to invite you to supper in
our village. There you will find them done to perfection."</p>

<p>Olive felt more and more uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," she said. "I should like to
come very much if it isn't too far; but I am afraid I
couldn't eat any supper. Indeed, I'm not hungry."
And then a bright thought struck her. "See here,"
she went on, drawing the half slice of bread out of
her pocket, "I had to put this in my pocket, for I
couldn't finish it at our afternoon coffee."</p>

<p>The two dwarfs came close and examined the piece
of bread with the greatest attention. They pinched<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
and smelt it, and one of them put out his queer little
pointed tongue and licked it.</p>

<p>"Not good!" he said, looking up at Olive and rolling
about his eyes in a very queer way.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Olive; "I don't think it can
be bad. It is the regular bread of the country. I
should have thought you would be accustomed to it,
as you live here."</p>

<p>The two dwarfs took no notice of what she said,
but suddenly turned round, and standing with their
backs to Olive called out shrilly, "Guten Tag."
Immediately all the other dwarfs replied in the same
tone and the same words, and to Olive's great surprise
they all began to move towards her, but without
altering their attitudes&mdash;those on the barrel rolled towards
her without getting off it; the two who were
hugging their knees continued to hug them, while
they came on by means of jerking themselves; the
turning head-over-heels ones span along like wheels,
and so on till the whole assemblage were at her feet.
Then she saw unfolded before her, hanging on the
branches of the tree, a large mantle, just the shape of
her aunt's travelling dust-cloak, which she always
spread over Olive in a carriage, only, instead of
being drab or fawn-coloured, it was, like the dwarfs'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
jackets, bright blue. And without any one telling
her, Olive seemed to know of herself that she was
to put it on.</p>

<p>She got up and reached the cloak easily; it seemed
to put itself on, and Olive felt very happy and
triumphant as she said to herself, "Now I'm really
going to have some adventures."</p>

<p>The dwarfs marched&mdash;no! one cannot call it
marching, for they had about a dozen different ways
of proceeding&mdash;they moved on, and Olive in the
middle, her blue cloak floating majestically on her
shoulders. No one spoke a word. It grew darker
and darker among the trees, but Olive did not feel
frightened. On they went, till at last she saw twinkling
before them a very small but bright blue light.
It looked scarcely larger than the lamp of a glow-worm,
but it shone out very distinct in the darkness.
Immediately they saw it the dwarfs set up a shout,
and as it died away, to Olive's surprise, they began
to sing. And what do you think they sang? Olive
at first could hardly believe her ears as they listened
to the thoroughly English song of "Home, sweet
Home." And the queerest thing was that they sang
it very prettily, and that it sounded exactly like her
aunt's voice! And though they were walking close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
beside her, their voices when they left off singing did
not so much seem to stop as to move off, to die
away into the distance, which struck Olive as very
odd.</p>

<p>They had now arrived at the trunk of a large tree,
half way up which hung the little lamp&mdash;at least
Olive supposed it must be a lamp&mdash;from which came
the bright blue light.</p>

<p>"Here we are," said one of the dwarfs, she did not
see which, "at the entrance to our village." And thereupon
all the dwarfs began climbing up the tree, swarming
about it like a hive of bees, till they got some way
up, when one after another they suddenly disappeared.
Olive could see all they did by the blue light. She
was beginning to wonder if she would be left standing
there alone, when a shout made her look up, and she
saw two dwarfs standing on a branch holding a rope
ladder, which they had just thrown down, and making
signs to her to mount up by it. It was quite easy;
up went Olive, step by step, and when she reached
the place where the two dwarfs were standing, she
saw how it was that they had all disappeared. The
tree trunk was hollow, and there were steps cut in it
like a stair, down which the dwarfs signed to her
that she was to go. She did not need to be twice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
told, so eager was she to see what was to come. The
stair was rather difficult for her to get down without
falling, for the steps were too small, being intended
for the dwarfs, but Olive managed pretty well, only
slipping now and then. The stair seemed very long,
and as she went farther it grew darker, till at last it
was quite dark; by which time, fortunately, however,
she felt herself again on level ground, and after waiting
half a minute a door seemed to open, and she
found herself standing outside the tree stair, with the
prettiest sight before her eyes that she had ever seen
or even imagined.</p>

<p>It was the dwarf village! Rows and rows of tiny
houses&mdash;none of them more than about twice as high
as Olive herself, for that was quite big enough for a
dwarf cottage, each with a sweet little garden in
front, like what one sees in English villages, though
the houses themselves were like Swiss ch&acirc;lets. It
was not dark down here, there was a soft light about
as bright as we have it at summer twilight; and
besides this, each little house had a twinkling blue
light hanging above the front door, like a sign-post.
And at the door of each cottage stood one of the
dwarfs, with a little dwarf wife beside him; only,
instead of blue, each little woman was dressed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
brown, so that they were rather less showy than their
husbands. They all began bowing as Olive appeared,
and all the little women curtseying, and Olive seemed
to understand, without being told, that she was to
walk up the village street to see all there was to be
seen. So on she marched, her blue cloak floating
about her, so that sometimes it reached the roofs of
the houses on each side at the same time.</p>

<p>Olive felt herself rather clumsy. Her feet, which
in general she was accustomed to consider rather
neat, and by no means too large for her age, seemed
such great awkward things. If she had put one of
them in at the window of a dwarf house, it would
have knocked everything out of its place.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" thought Olive, "I had no idea <i>I</i>
could seem clumsy! I feel like a great ploughman.
I wish I were not so big."</p>

<p>"Yes," said a voice beside her, "it has its disadvantages;"
and Olive, looking down to see who
spoke&mdash;she had to look down for everything&mdash;caught
sight of one of the two dwarfs with whom she had
first spoken. She felt a little ruffled. She did not
like this trick of the dwarf hearing what she thought
before she said it.</p>

<p>"Everything has its disadvantages," she replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
"Don't you find yourself very inconveniently small
when you are up in <i>our</i> world?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so," said the dwarf; but he did not seem
the least put out.</p>

<p>"They are certainly very good-tempered," said
Olive to herself. Then suddenly a thought struck her.</p>

<p>"Your village is very neat and pretty," she said;
"though, perhaps&mdash;I don't mean to be rude, not on
any account&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No," interrupted the dwarf; "Auntie told you
on no account to be rude."</p>

<p>"Auntie!" repeated Olive, in astonishment; "she
is not <i>your</i> auntie!"</p>

<p>"On no account," said the dwarf, in the same calm
tone, but without seeming to take in that Olive meant
to reprove him.</p>

<p>"It's no use trying to make them understand,"
said Olive to herself.</p>

<p>"Not the least," said the dwarf; at which Olive
felt so provoked that she could have stamped her
feet with irritation. But as <i>thinking</i> crossly seemed
in this country to be quite as bad as <i>speaking</i> crossly,
she had to try to swallow down her vexation as well
as she could.</p>

<p>"I was going to say," she went on quietly, "that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to my taste the village would be prettier if there was
a little variety. Not all the houses just the same,
you know. And all of <i>you</i> are so like each other,
and all your little brown wives too. Are there no
<i>children</i> dwarfs?"</p>

<p>"Doubtless. Any quantity," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Then where are they all?" said Olive. "Are
they all asleep?" She put the last question rather
sarcastically, but the sarcasm seemed to be lost on
the little man.</p>

<p>"Yes, all asleep," he replied; "all asleep, and
dreaming. Children are very fond of dreaming," he
went on, looking up at Olive with such a queer
expression, and such a queer tone in his voice too,
that Olive got a queer feeling herself, as if he meant
more than his words actually said. Could he mean
to hint that <i>she</i> was dreaming? But a remark from
the dwarf distracted her thoughts.</p>

<p>"Supper is ready," he said. "They are all waiting."
And turning round, Olive saw before her a cottage a
good deal larger than the others; in fact, it was almost
high enough for her, with considerable stooping, to get
in at the door. And through the windows she saw a
long table neatly covered with a bright blue tablecloth,
and spread with numbers of tiny plates, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
beside each plate a knife and fork and a little blue
glass cup. Two great dishes stood on the table,
one at each end. Steam was rising from each,
and a delicious smell came out through the open
windows.</p>

<p>"I did not know I was so hungry," thought Olive;
"but I do <i>hope</i> it isn't fir-cones."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the dwarf; "they'll be better done
this time."</p>

<p>Then he gave a sort of sharp, sudden cry or
whistle, and immediately all the dwarfs of the village
appeared as if by magic, and began hurrying into the
house, but as soon as they were in the middle of the
passage they fell back at each side, leaving a clear
space in the middle.</p>

<p>"For you," said the first dwarf, bowing politely.</p>

<p>"Do you always have supper here altogether like
that?" said Olive. "How funny!"</p>

<p>"Not at all," said the dwarf; "it's a table d'h&ocirc;te.
Be so good as to take your place."</p>

<p>Olive bent her head cautiously in preparation for
passing through the door, when again the same sharp
cry startled her, and lifting her head suddenly she
bumped it against the lintel. The pain of the blow
was rather severe.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"What did you do that for?" she exclaimed
angrily. "Why did you scream out like that? I&mdash;&mdash;"
But she said no more. The cry was repeated, and
this time it did its work effectually, for Olive awoke.
Awoke&mdash;was it waking?&mdash;to find herself all in the
dark, stiff and cold, and her head aching with the
bump she had given it against the old tree-trunk,
while farther off now she heard the same shrill hoot
or cry of some early astir night-bird, which had
sounded before in her dreams.</p>

<p>"Oh dear! oh dear!" she sobbed, "what shall I
do? Where am I? How can I ever find my way
in the dark? I believe it was all a trick of those
nasty blue dwarfs. I don't believe I <i>was</i> dreaming.
They must be spiteful goblins. I wish I had not
gone with them to see their village." And so for
some minutes, half asleep and half awake, Olive
stayed crouching by the tree, which seemed her only
protector. But by degrees, as her senses&mdash;her common
sense particularly&mdash;came back to her, she began
to realise that it was worse than useless to sit there
crying. Dark as it was, she must try to find her way
back to the little inn, where, doubtless, Auntie and
the others were in the greatest distress about her, the
thought of which nearly made her burst out crying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
again; and poor Olive stumbled up to her feet as best
she could, fortunately not forgetting to feel for her
book and parasol which were lying beside her, and
slowly and tremblingly made her way on a few steps,
hoping that perhaps if she could manage to get out of
the shadow of the trees it might not be quite so dark
farther on. She was not altogether disappointed.
It certainly grew a very little less black, but that it
was a very dark night there was no denying. And,
indeed, though it had not been dark, she would have
had the greatest difficulty in finding her way out of the
wood, into which she had so thoughtlessly penetrated.
Terrifying thoughts, too, began to crowd into her
mind, though, as I think I have shown you, she
was not at all a timid child. But a forest on a dark
night, and so far away from everywhere&mdash;it was
enough to shake her nerves. She hoped and trusted
there was no fear of wolves in summer-time; but
bears!&mdash;ah! as to bears there was no telling. Even
the hooting cries of the birds which she now and
then again heard in the distance frightened her,
and she felt that a bat flapping against her would
send her nearly out of her mind. And after a while
she began to lose heart&mdash;it was not quite so dark,
but she had not the very least idea where she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
going. She kept bumping and knocking herself
against the trunks; she was evidently not in a path,
but wandering farther and farther among the forest
trees. That was about all she could feel sure of, and
after two or three more vain efforts Olive fairly gave
up, and, sinking down on the ground, again burst
into tears.</p>

<p>"If I but had a mariner's compass," she thought,
her fancy wandering off to all the stories of lost people
she had ever heard of. Then she further reflected
that a compass would do her very little good if it
was too dark to see it, and still more as she had not
the slightest idea whether her road lay north, south,
east, or west. "If the stars were out!" was her next
idea; but then, I am ashamed to say, Olive's ideas
of astronomy were limited. She could have perhaps
recognised the Plough and the Pole star, but she
could not remember which way they pointed. Besides,
she did not feel quite sure that in Th&uuml;ringen
one would see the same stars as in England or Paris;
and, after all, as there were none visible, it was no
good puzzling about it, only if they <i>had</i> been there it
would not have seemed so lonely. Suddenly&mdash;what
was that in the distance? A light, a tiny light,
bobbing in and out of sight among the trees? Could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
it be a star come out of its way to take pity on her?
Much more likely a Will-o'-the-wisp; for she did not
stop to reflect that a dry pine forest in summer-time
is not one of Will-o'-the-wisp's favourite playgrounds.
It was a light, as to that there was no doubt, and it
was coming nearer. Whether she was more frightened
or glad Olive scarcely knew. Still, almost anything
was better than to sit there to be eaten up by bears,
or to die of starvation; and she eagerly watched the
light now steadily approaching her, till it came near
enough for her to see that it was a lantern carried by
some person not high above the ground. A boy perhaps;
could it be&mdash;oh, joyful thought!&mdash;could it be
Rex? But no; even if they were all looking for her
it was not likely that they would let Rex be running
about alone to get lost too. Still, it must <i>be</i> a boy,
and without waiting to think more Olive called
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, please come and help me! I'm lost in the
wood!" she cried, thinking nothing of German or
anything but her sore distress.</p>

<p>The lantern moved about undecidedly for a moment
or two, then the light flashed towards her and came
still nearer.</p>

<p>"<i>Ach Gott!</i>" exclaimed an unfamiliar voice, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Olive, peering forward, thought for half a second
she was again dreaming. He was not, certainly,
dressed in blue, and he was a good deal taller
than up to her knee; but still he was&mdash;there was
no doubt about it&mdash;he was a dwarf! And another
gaze at his queer little figure and bright sparkling
eyes told Olive that it was the very same
little man who had smiled at Rex and her when he
saw them leaning out of the inn window that very
afternoon.</p>

<p>She didn't feel frightened; he looked so good-natured
and so sorry for her. And somehow Olive's
faith in the possible existence of a nation of dwarfs
had received a shock; she was much more inclined
to take things prosaically. But it was very difficult to
explain matters. I think the dwarf at the first moment
was more inclined to take <i>her</i> for something supernatural
than she was now to imagine him a brownie
or a gnome. For she was a pretty little girl, with a
mass of golden fair hair and English blue eyes; and
with her hat half fallen off, and her cheeks flushed,
she might have sat for a picture of a fairy who had
strayed from her home.</p>

<p>Her German seemed all to go out of her head.
But she managed to remember the name of the village<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
where they had been that afternoon, and a sudden recollection
seemed to come over the dwarf. He poured
out a flood of words and exclamations, amidst which
all that Olive could understand was the name of the
village and the words "<i>verirrt</i>," "<i>armes Kind</i>," which
she knew meant "lost" and "poor child." Then he
went on to tell that he too was on his way from the
same village to somewhere; that he came by the
woods, because it was shorter, and lifting high his
lantern, gave Olive to understand that he could now
show her the way.</p>

<p>So off she set under his guidance, and, only
fancy! a walk of not more than ten minutes brought
them to the little inn! Olive's wanderings and
straying had, after all, drawn her very near her
friends if she had known it. Poor Auntie and Rex
were running about in front of the house in
great distress. Uncle and the landlord and the
coachman had set off with lanterns, and the landlady
was trying to persuade Auntie that there was
not <i>really</i> anything to be afraid of; neither bears,
nor wolves, nor evilly-disposed people about: the
little young lady had, doubtless, fallen asleep in the
wood with the heat and fatigue of the day; which,
as you know, was a very good guess, though the landlady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
little imagined what queer places and people
Olive had been visiting in her sleep.</p>

<p>The dwarf was a well-known person thereabouts,
and a very harmless, kindly little man. A present
of a couple of marks sent him off to his cottage near
by very happy indeed, and when Uncle returned a
few minutes later to see if the wanderer had been
heard of, you can imagine how thankful he was to
find her. It was not so <i>very</i> late after all, not above
half-past ten o'clock, but a thunderstorm which came
on not long after explained the unusual darkness of
the cloud-covered sky.</p>

<p>"<i>What</i> a good thing you were safe before the
storm came on!" said Auntie, with a shudder at
the thought of the dangers her darling had escaped.
"I will take care never again to carry my jokes
too far," she resolved, when Olive had confided to
her the real motive of her wanderings in the
wood. And Olive, for her part, decided that she
would be content with fairies and dwarfs in
books and fancy, without trying to find them in
reality.</p>

<p>"Though all the same," she said to herself, "I
should have liked to taste the roast fir-cones. They
did smell so good!" "And, Auntie," she said aloud,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
"were you singing in the wood on your way home
with Uncle and Rex?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Auntie, "they begged me to sing
'Home, sweet Home.' Why do you ask me?"</p>

<p>Olive explained. "So it was <i>your</i> voice I heard
when I thought it was the dwarfs," she said, smiling.</p>

<p>And Auntie gave her still another kiss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Salmon</span>, writing in the <i>Nineteenth Century</i>,
October 1887, said: "I have left till the last any mention of the
lady who, by right of merit, should stand first. Mrs. Molesworth
is, in my opinion, considering the quality and quantity of her
labours, the best story-teller for children England has yet known.
This is a bold statement and requires substantiation. Mrs. Molesworth,
during the last six years, has never failed to occupy a prominent
place among the juvenile writers of the season.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs.
Molesworth's great charm is her realism&mdash;realism, that is, in the
purest and highest sense.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mrs. Molesworth's children are
finished studies. She is never sentimental, but writes common
sense in a straightforward manner. A joyous earnest spirit pervades
her work, and her sympathy is unbounded. She loves them
with her whole heart, while she lays bare their little minds, and
expresses their foibles, their faults, their virtues, their inward
struggles, their conception of duty, and their instinctive knowledge
of the right and wrong of things. She knows their characters, she
understands their wants, and she desires to help them. The only
sure talisman against domestic trouble she evidently believes to
be the absolute trust of a child in its parents."</p>
